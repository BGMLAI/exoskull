# Gender socialization of boys: What research reveals about maternal and female caregiver influence

Boys receive **less emotional talk and coaching from parents** than girls—a finding consistently replicated across developmental psychology research. However, the academic literature on who transmits masculine norms presents a more complex picture than commonly assumed. The major scholars in this field—Niobe Way, Judy Chu, William Pollack—unanimously attribute norm transmission to "men and women alike" and to culture broadly, not primarily to mothers or female caregivers. While gender-differentiated parenting by mothers is well-documented, research has not established causal pathways specifically linking maternal socialization to negative male mental health outcomes.

## Mothers do talk less about emotions with sons than daughters

Robyn Fivush's longitudinal research at Emory University provides the strongest evidence for differential emotion socialization. Her team found that both mothers and fathers use a **greater number and variety of emotion words with daughters** than with sons. Conversations about sadness run longer with daughters, and parents mention sad aspects of events more frequently with girls. By age 70 months, girls mention more unique emotion terms than boys—despite showing no differences at 40-month baseline testing—suggesting socialization effects rather than innate differences.

A landmark 2019 study by Kristel Thomassin using implicit association tests found that **mothers (not fathers) showed implicit bias against boys crying**. Mothers found images of crying boys "unpleasant" and favored girls expressing sadness and anger over boys expressing the same emotions. Fathers showed no such gender bias. This represents some of the clearest evidence that mothers specifically may treat boys' emotional expressions less favorably.

Tara Chaplin's 2013 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin*, encompassing **555 effect sizes from 166 studies and 21,709 participants**, confirmed gender differences in children's emotion expression. Girls showed more positive emotions (g = −.08) and internalizing emotions (g = −.10), while boys showed more externalizing emotions (g = .09). These effects, while statistically significant, are **very small**—a critical caveat. Gender differences also increased with age, were less pronounced with parents than with peers, and varied substantially by ethnicity.

## The "Man Box" is enforced by society broadly—including both parents

Promundo's Man Box studies surveyed 3,600+ young men ages 18-30 across the US, UK, and Mexico. The research explicitly identifies enforcement from **multiple sources simultaneously**: parents (both mothers and fathers), romantic partners, male peers, media, and society broadly. Approximately **47-59% of young men** reported parents teaching them a "real man should act strong even if nervous or scared."

Notably, the Australian Man Box study found young men are **more likely to seek emotional support from women** (romantic partners and mothers) than from men. When sad or depressed, men turned first to romantic partners (27-45%), then mothers (33-37%), with **fathers ranking substantially lower (13-19%)**. This complicates narratives positioning women primarily as enforcers rather than supporters.

A critical finding: men *inside* the Man Box—those most adherent to traditional masculine norms—were **statistically more likely to seek help from their fathers** on masculinity issues (19.4% vs 13.1%). This suggests fathers may play a greater role in reinforcing traditional masculinity for men who most strongly conform to those norms.

## Key researchers explicitly reject attributing transmission primarily to women

Niobe Way's 20-year longitudinal research documented in *Deep Secrets* found that adolescent boys have intensely intimate friendships in early high school, then lose these connections by senior year—"right at the developmental moment when the rate of suicide among boys becomes four times that of girls." Regarding who socializes boys, Way is unambiguous: **"We pass this training on, men and women alike, to generation after generation of bright eyed, loving little boys."**

Judy Chu's two-year ethnographic study in *When Boys Become Boys* observed boys ages 4-6 becoming progressively less emotionally perceptive and expressive. Her research describes parents and teachers as "almost unwittingly" complicit in socialization but attributes the change to **"cultural socialization"** broadly—not to any specific gender of caregiver.

William Pollack's *Real Boys* research at Harvard explicitly identifies "fathers, mothers, teachers and coaches" as collectively enforcing the "Boy Code." However, Pollack **strongly defends mother-son closeness**: "Far from making boys weaker, the love of a mother can and does actually make boys stronger emotionally and psychologically." He argues boys are forced to separate from mothers **too early** and that "disrupting a boy's desire to stay connected to his mother is devastating and traumatic."

## Female teachers dominate early education, but effects on boys remain unclear

Statistics on gender composition in education are stark: **94-98% of preschool/kindergarten teachers** and **89% of elementary teachers** are female. Combined with mothers providing approximately twice the childcare hours of fathers, boys spend the overwhelming majority of their formative years with female caregivers.

Research on grading bias shows mixed patterns. French and Israeli studies found teachers favor girls in math evaluations—but studies on perceived mathematical ability found **female teachers also assumed boys had higher ability than girls**, particularly girls of color. Discipline data reveals boys receive approximately 79-82% of preschool suspensions despite representing 54% of enrollment, though whether this reflects bias versus behavioral differences remains debated.

The critical question—whether female teacher predominance harms boys—yields **largely inconclusive evidence**. A comprehensive German study using administrative data on all students and teachers found "hardly any effects of teacher gender" on outcomes. A 7-year Indiana study found "female teachers are better at increasing both male and female students' achievement" than male teachers. Multiple well-designed studies find no benefit to boys from having male teachers. The "feminization of education" hypothesis, while popular, lacks robust empirical support.

## Correlational—not causal—links to male mental health outcomes

The meta-analysis by Wong et al. (2017), analyzing **78 samples and 19,453 participants**, found conformity to masculine norms was "modestly and unfavorably associated with mental health" (r ≤ 0.19). Three norms were most harmful: **self-reliance, power over women, and playboy orientation**. However, the effect size is small—approximately **5% shared variance**—indicating other factors are far more influential.

The "normative male alexithymia hypothesis" proposes that traditional masculine socialization produces difficulty identifying and expressing emotions in many men. Studies link childhood emotional neglect/abuse to adult alexithymia. A systematic review found **96% of papers** showed associations between masculine norm conformity and suicide risk.

However, **causal claims specifically linking maternal emotional socialization to these outcomes require substantial caution**. Most studies are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Research examines combined parental socialization, not maternal effects isolated from paternal, peer, or cultural influences. Effect sizes are consistently small. Bidirectional relationships—where children's characteristics shape parenting—confound interpretation. The research more strongly supports broad cultural masculine socialization affecting men than specifically maternal transmission.

## Research on mothers enforcing stricter norms on sons shows nuanced patterns

Studies do confirm gender-differentiated parenting. Garside and Klimes-Dougan (2002) found parents tended to "punish negative emotions (sadness, anger, fear) in boys while reinforcing the same emotions in girls." A 2024 study found mothers of girls displayed higher levels of coaching negative emotions than mothers of boys (d = 0.17—a small effect).

However, research also shows **fathers may be more gender-differentiating** than mothers for certain behaviors. European American fathers were found "especially likely to differentially encourage and reinforce the expression of gender-stereotyped emotion." A PMC study found fathers with more traditional gender stereotypes used more physical discipline specifically with boys.

Research on "maternal gatekeeping"—mothers limiting fathers' involvement in childcare—does show associations with reduced father involvement. But scholars note gatekeeping can be facilitative rather than purely restrictive, some fathers view it positively, and it often reflects broader structural inequalities rather than individual choices.

## Conclusion: The evidence defies simple narratives

The academic literature confirms that **gender-differentiated emotional socialization by parents is real and consequential**. Mothers do use fewer emotion words with sons, show implicit bias against boys' crying, and coach daughters' emotions more than sons'. These patterns contribute to boys developing smaller emotional vocabularies and more restricted expressiveness.

However, the research does **not support** attributing masculine norm transmission primarily to mothers or female caregivers. The leading scholars in this field—Way, Chu, Pollack, Kimmel, Gilligan—unanimously describe transmission as coming from culture broadly, with "men and women alike" participating. Fathers appear to play a particularly significant role for men most adherent to traditional masculinity. Female dominance in education does not demonstrably harm boys' academic outcomes in well-designed studies.

The correlational evidence linking masculine norms to poor mental health is consistent but effect sizes are small. Causal pathways specifically from maternal socialization to negative outcomes remain **theoretically plausible but empirically unestablished**. Research more consistently implicates broad cultural factors, peer socialization (especially in adolescence), and general childhood adversity—not uniquely maternal influences.

A more accurate framing, based on the evidence: mothers and female caregivers participate in cultural gender socialization alongside fathers, male caregivers, peers, media, and institutions—with each playing distinct roles that vary by context, ethnicity, and individual family dynamics. The solution proposed by researchers is not blame of any particular group but rather societal-level change in how all adults—men and women alike—socialize emotional expression in boys.
