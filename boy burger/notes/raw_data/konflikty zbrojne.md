# Sexual violence in armed conflicts: Empirical evidence from Poland to global patterns

**Sexual violence in warfare affects tens of millions worldwide, with verified cases surging 50% in 2023 alone.** The UN documented over 3,600 cases last year across 24 conflict situations—yet experts consistently describe this as merely the "tip of the iceberg." From Poland's suppressed history of Soviet mass rape to Ukraine's unprecedented documentation of male victimization, the empirical record reveals both horrifying patterns and critical gaps in recognition, prosecution, and survivor support. This report synthesizes evidence across conflicts spanning eight decades, revealing that while international legal frameworks have evolved substantially since the 1990s, implementation remains deeply inadequate.

## Poland's buried trauma: From WWII occupation to refugee response

### Soviet Army sexual violence (1944-45) remains Poland's silenced catastrophe

Polish government estimates indicate **more than 100,000 women and girls** were raped by Red Army soldiers during the 1944-45 "liberation," though historians Joanna Ostrowska and Marcin Zaremba note this figure "remains a matter of guesswork" due to systematic suppression of records. For comparison, estimates for Germany reach **2 million rapes**, with at least 100,000 women violated in Berlin alone. Documented patterns in Poland reveal staggering brutality: victims ranged from ages 9 to 80, with reports from Olsztyn stating "practically no woman survived without being violated." The Pomeranian Voivodeship, Silesia, and the Warmia-Masuria region experienced the highest concentrations, with sexually transmitted disease rates reaching 50% of the female population in Masuria by mid-1945.

The communist regime enforced complete silence through the Main Office for Control of Press, Publications and Performances (GUKPiW), classifying discussion of Soviet crimes as "defamation of an ally state." Administrative records of rapes ceased abruptly by late summer 1945—deliberate censorship rather than an end to violence, which continued through 1947. The first comprehensive Polish book on WWII sexual violence, Ostrowska's *Przemilczane* ("Unmentioned"), was not published until 2018, nearly three decades after the fall of communism.

Nazi occupation brought a parallel system of sexual exploitation through over **500 military brothels** across occupied Europe. Polish women were kidnapped in street roundups called *łapanka* and forced into sexual servitude. Concentration camp brothels at Mauthausen, Buchenwald, Dachau, and Auschwitz exploited **300-400 women** from Ravensbrück, required to service 6-8 men nightly. Nazi race laws created perverse hierarchies: Polish prisoners could only access Slavic women, while Jewish women were explicitly excluded. No survivors have received recognition or compensation as Nazi victims.

### Poland's response to Ukrainian refugees shows progress amid persistent risks

Since February 2022, over **7.2 million border crossings** from Ukraine to Poland have occurred, with approximately **1 million Ukrainians** now registered under temporary protection—making Poland the EU's second-largest host after Germany. The demographic profile creates unique vulnerabilities: roughly **90% are women and children**, as men 18-60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine under martial law.

International agencies issued immediate warnings. UNHCR declared "high alert" about predatory individuals and criminal networks in April 2022, while the Council of Europe warned of trafficking risks unprecedented since WWII. Polish National Police launched **five investigations** into possible trafficking of Ukrainian refugees. A widely reported case involved a 49-year-old Polish man arrested in Wrocław for raping a 19-year-old Ukrainian woman who had accepted housing through an internet offer. Reports emerged of drivers requesting "sexual favors" for transport and women subjected to forced labor in exchange for accommodation.

Poland's response has been substantial but uneven. March 2022 legislation increased trafficking penalties to 10-15 years (25 years for severe cases involving the Russian war). The Inter-Ministerial Team for Counteracting Human Trafficking was established in September 2023, and Poland achieved **Tier 1 status** in the 2024 US State Department Trafficking Report. However, Human Rights Watch documented a lack of systematic screening at border crossings, inconsistent vetting of private transportation offers, and volunteer-dependent response systems with limited training. Provincial anti-trafficking teams remain "uncoordinated and inconsistent."

## Ukraine 2022-present: Unprecedented documentation reveals systematic patterns

### Russian forces have employed sexual violence as systematic torture

The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission has documented **433 cases** of conflict-related sexual violence in Ukraine from February 2022 through December 2024, affecting 302 men, 119 women, 10 girls, and 2 boys. A striking finding challenges assumptions: **70% of documented victims are male**, reflecting systematic sexual torture in Russian detention facilities. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office has registered **335 cases**, issued 60 suspicion notices to Russian servicemen, and secured **5 convictions** with sentences of 10-12 years.

The types of violence documented reveal deliberate brutalization: rape and gang rape (including before family members), electrocution of genitals, penetration with objects including batons and bottles, forced nudity, castration, and threats used for intimidation. UN Special Representative Pramila Patten described rape as "clearly a military strategy" and "deliberate tactic to dehumanize victims," citing victim ages ranging from **4 to 82 years**. Regions with highest concentrations include Bucha (at least 25 women/girls systematically raped in a basement), Izium (mass graves with 447 bodies showing torture signs), and Kherson Oblast (50 recorded male sexual violence cases in a single investigation).

Perpetrators span Russian military structures: regular armed forces, GRU military intelligence, FSB, Rosgvardia (National Guard), and Chechen Akhmat paramilitaries. A July 2022 video documented castration of a Ukrainian POW at Pryvillia Sanatorium by Akhmat members. The *Sunday Times* reported in June 2023 on two POWs castrated with a knife in captivity. Prosecutor Didenko observed: "Ground forces arrive, and rapes start on the second or third day."

### Male victims in Ukraine represent historically unprecedented documentation

The Ukraine conflict has produced the most extensive documentation of male CRSV in any single conflict. All Survivors Project executive director Charu Lata Hogg called the scale "unprecedented" compared to their 30-year global database. A survey of 60 former male POWs found **39 (65%) reported sexual violence in detention**. Forms include systematic electrocution of genitals, threats of rape and castration occurring "almost every day," forced nudity during tattoo inspections, and penetration with objects.

The UN Commission of Inquiry found sexual violence used in "almost all" detention centers investigated. Barriers to male reporting remain severe: stigma around perceived emasculation, fear of conscription if approaching authorities, lack of urological support services initially, and digital exploitation through shared torture videos. UNFPA estimates **10-20 actual cases per 1 registered case**, suggesting the true scale far exceeds documented numbers.

## Historical conflicts: Documented atrocities from Bosnia to the Yazidi genocide

### Bosnia (1992-95) established systematic rape as crime against humanity

Estimates for Bosnia range from **20,000 to 50,000 rape victims**, though the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe concluded "the real number will probably never be established." The UN Commission of Experts documented rape employed with commander support, with perpetrators stating they were ordered to "plant the seed of Serbs in Bosnia." Women were detained for months in "rape camps" including Foča-area facilities, held until abortion was no longer possible to ensure births.

The ICTY's Foča trial (Kunarac, Kovač, Vuković) became the **first international prosecution exclusively focused on sexual violence**, establishing rape as a crime against humanity and sexual enslavement as distinct international crime. Dragoljub Kunarac received 28 years, Radomir Kovač 20 years, and Zoran Vuković 12 years. By 2011, more than one-third of ICTY convictees had been found guilty of sexual violence crimes.

Sexual violence against men was systematic in Bosnian detention camps. An anonymous study of 6,000 concentration camp inmates from Sarajevo canton found **80% of male detainees reported being sexually assaulted**. At Omarska, guards forced a detainee to bite off another detainee's testicles. At Čelebići, guards forced brothers to commit fellatio on each other while watching. The Tadić case became the **first-ever international war crimes trial involving charges of sexual violence against men**.

### Rwanda (1994) produced the first genocide conviction for rape

The Rwandan genocide saw an estimated **250,000-500,000 women and girls raped** within 100 days—a UN Special Rapporteur described rape as "the rule and its absence the exception." Tutsi women were systematically targeted due to both gender and ethnicity, with propaganda from Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines portraying them as a "seductive fifth column." HIV was deliberately weaponized: Hutu extremists released AIDS patients from hospitals to form "rape squads," with perpetrators explicitly stating intent to give victims "slow death from AIDS." By 2001, **70% of rape survivors tested HIV-positive**.

The **Akayesu case** (September 2, 1998) produced multiple historic firsts: first international conviction for genocide, first recognition of rape as constituting genocide, and first international definition of rape. The tribunal found "sexual violence was an integral part of the process of destruction of the Tutsi ethnic group." Children born of forced impregnation—estimates range from **2,000 to 25,000**—are called *enfants mauvais souvenir* ("children of bad memories") and face severe stigmatization.

### The DRC earned the grim designation "rape capital of the world"

UN Special Representative Margot Wallström applied this term to eastern DRC, calling it "the most dangerous place on earth to be a woman." A 2007 Demographic Health Survey estimated **1.69-1.80 million women** had experienced rape in their lifetime, with 407,000-434,000 raped in the preceding 12 months. In 2024, MSF treated nearly **40,000 sexual violence survivors** in North Kivu province alone. Dr. Denis Mukwege, founder of Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, has treated over 30,000 survivors and documented injuries including gunshots to genitals and chemicals poured on genitals post-assault—work that earned him the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize.

Both state forces and non-state militias perpetrate violence. MONUSCO data from 2024 attributed 27% of verified incidents to FARDC (government forces) and 76% to non-state armed groups including Mai-Mai militias, M23, and remnants of the Lord's Resistance Army. Harvard research documented a **17-fold increase in civilian-perpetrated rape** between 2004-2008, and intimate partner sexual violence remains "the most pervasive form" across DRC.

### ISIS created an institutionalized sexual slavery system targeting Yazidis

ISIS sought religious justification before the August 2014 attack on Sinjar, classifying Yazidis as *mushrikin* (polytheists) without Quranic protection. The resulting system was institutionalized: slave markets (*souk sabaya*) operated in Raqqa and other cities, with sales documented via formal contracts notarized by ISIS courts. Prices ranged from **$500 for a child to $8,000 advertised on social media**. Virgins were selected for commanders; gynecologists examined captives and performed forced abortions.

Estimates of Yazidi women and girls enslaved range from **5,000 to 7,000**. As of 2025, approximately **2,800-3,000 Yazidis remain unaccounted for**, including 1,300 children. Over 200,000 Yazidis remain displaced in Iraq. Nobel laureate Nadia Murad's testimony described being held with 150+ Yazidi families and exchanged as gifts. Germany achieved the first universal jurisdiction conviction for ISIS sexual slavery in 2021.

### Syria's detention system employed systematic sexual torture

Syrian Network for Human Rights documented **136,614 people detained** from 2011-2024. Syrian Human Rights Network recorded 11,553 incidents of sexual violence against women and girls, with 8,024 attributed to the Assad government. Sednaya Prison—the "Human Slaughterhouse"—saw an estimated 5,000-30,000 killed. The **Caesar photos** (55,000 images smuggled by a military police defector) documented 6,786 torture victims, showing starvation, brutal beatings, and evidence of systematic abuse.

Sexual torture of male detainees was routine: electric shocks to genitals, forced oral rape between prisoners while guards recorded on phones, penetration with bottles, and systematic targeting of younger detainees. Medical professionals treating Syrian torture survivors report the **majority of male detainees** in government facilities experienced severe sexual violence. Germany's universal jurisdiction prosecutions have achieved convictions including life imprisonment for Anwar Raslan, a former Mukhabarat colonel.

## Military sexual assault in peacetime: NATO and UN peacekeeping patterns

### US military shows first decline in sexual assault in nearly a decade

The FY2024 DoD report documented **8,195 total reports** (4% decrease from 8,515 in FY2023). The FY2023 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey showed the first prevalence decrease in nearly a decade: **6.8% of women** and **1.3% of men** experienced unwanted sexual contact, down from 8.4% and 1.5% respectively in 2021—representing an estimated 7,000 fewer assaulted personnel.

However, independent analysis suggests actual rates are **2-4 times higher** than DoD estimates. The Brown University Costs of War Project estimates 75,569 cases in 2021 versus DoD's 35,900. Reporting rates have actually declined: only 20% of assaults were reported in 2021, down from 30% in 2018. Conviction rates have plummeted—from an estimated 26,000 assaults in FY2012, only ~200 resulted in convictions. **64% of women who reported assault faced retaliation**, with a third discharged within 7 months of reporting.

FY2022-2023 NDAA reforms removed commanders from sexual assault investigation decisions, created independent Special Trial Counsel, made sexual harassment a standalone UCMJ offense, and eliminated the statute of limitations for sexual assault. Outcomes from these reforms remain to be seen.

### European militaries reveal pervasive harassment patterns

The UK's first comprehensive survey (2025) found **67% of full-time female personnel** experienced at least one sexualized behavior in the preceding 12 months. One-third experienced unwanted physical touching; **one in ten women** experienced sexual assault. Four-fifths of women with "particularly upsetting" experiences did not report, citing beliefs that "nothing would be done" (60%) and career impact fears (52%).

France's COSEMIL survey (2021) found **36.7% of women** and **17.5% of men** experienced military sexual trauma in the past year, with 12.6% of women and 3.5% of men reporting sexual assault. Canada's 2022 survey showed **3.5% of Regular Force members** (1,960 personnel) experienced sexual assault in 12 months—a significant increase from 1.6% in 2018. Germany reported 234 sexual offense cases in 2017, including 14 rapes (nearly 3x the 2016 figure).

### UN peacekeeping sexual abuse demonstrates systemic accountability failures

The UN system received **758 allegations** of sexual exploitation and abuse in 2023, with 100 in peacekeeping and political missions. MONUSCO (DRC) and MINUSCA (Central African Republic) account for **90% of peacekeeping allegations**. Major scandals include a Sri Lankan child sex ring in Haiti involving at least 134 peacekeepers over 10 years (114 sent home, none charged), and 98 girls abused by Burundian and Gabonese peacekeepers in CAR (2014-2015), including cases of forced bestiality.

The fundamental accountability gap persists: **the UN has no jurisdiction to prosecute peacekeepers**. Prosecution falls to troop-contributing countries, which rarely take action. Of ~2,000 allegations pre-2017, only ~53 documented disciplinary actions beyond repatriation occurred—an **estimated >90% impunity rate**. Since 2006, approximately **750 paternity claims** have been filed against peacekeeping personnel, with over 500 still pending. These "peacekeeper babies" face stigmatization and abandonment with virtually no support.

## Male victims: The recognition gap in conflict-related sexual violence

Sexual violence against men and boys has been documented in **over 25 armed conflicts** in recent decades, yet remains severely underreported. The Bosnia study finding 80% of male camp detainees sexually assaulted, the DRC research showing 23.6% of men in eastern regions experienced sexual violence, and Ukraine's documentation that 70% of verified CRSV victims are male collectively challenge the assumption that wartime sexual violence primarily affects women.

Forms of violence against men include rape and gang rape, forced sexual acts between male victims (the most common form in Bosnia per OSCE), electrocution of genitals, castration, and penetration with objects. In Syria, guards forced younger prisoners to rape older ones while filming. In DRC, sexual violence is used to "emasculate" victims and destroy community structures. The Refugee Law Project in Uganda, led by Dr. Chris Dolan until 2022, pioneered programming for male survivors and documented how victims face abandonment by spouses and community rejection.

Legal recognition has evolved significantly. The Rome Statute (1998) was explicitly **gender-neutral** in defining sexual violence crimes. The ICTY's Tadić case (1997) became the first international trial involving sexual violence charges against men. Jean-Pierre Bemba's 2016 ICC conviction (later overturned on other grounds) explicitly clarified that the crime of rape is gender-neutral. Yet many national laws still define rape in gendered terms requiring female victims, and **over 60 countries** criminalize consensual same-sex relations—creating impossible barriers for male victims whose assault may be conflated with homosexuality.

---

## International legal framework: Evolution and enforcement gaps

### The Rome Statute established comprehensive definitions

The Rome Statute (2002) was the **first international treaty** to explicitly establish conflict-related sexual violence as distinct crimes under international law. Article 7(1)(g) lists crimes against humanity including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, and "any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity." Identical provisions appear in war crimes articles for both international and non-international armed conflicts.

ICC convictions have been limited but significant:
- **Bosco Ntaganda (2019)**: 30 years for 18 counts including rape and sexual slavery—first ICC case charging sexual violence against child soldiers within the same armed group
- **Dominic Ongwen (2021)**: 25 years for 61 counts including 19 specific to sexual violence—**first-ever conviction for forced pregnancy** at any international court
- **Jean-Pierre Bemba (2016)**: Convicted but **overturned on appeal in 2018**, establishing stricter standards that make future command responsibility prosecutions more difficult

### UN Security Council resolutions created framework without enforcement

Resolution 1325 (2000) was the **first-ever** Security Council resolution addressing conflict's impact on women. Resolution 1820 (2008) first recognized sexual violence as a weapon and tactic of warfare. Resolution 1888 (2009) created the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Resolution 1960 (2010) mandated "naming and shaming" of perpetrators. Resolution 2467 (2019) emphasized survivor-centered approaches and root causes including structural gender inequality.

Implementation has been criticized for lacking binding enforcement mechanisms, no benchmarks or targets, and focus primarily on peacekeeping operations. The "woman as victim" paradigm persists despite Resolution 1325's empowerment focus.

### Prosecution challenges remain formidable

Evidence gathering faces cultural barriers (women may not disclose to male investigators), stigma (survivors face ostracization if identified), time lapses of years between crimes and investigation, and lack of medical documentation. ICC charging patterns show SGBV charges are "more vulnerable to being dismissed, re-characterized or dropped"—five of seven dropped charges in early ICC cases were SGBV charges. The Lubanga case included no sexual violence charges despite evidence of widespread rape of child soldiers.

Universal jurisdiction prosecutions, particularly in Germany, offer alternative pathways. Germany has conducted **over 100 investigations** under its 2002 Code of Crimes against International Law, securing convictions including life imprisonment for Syrian intelligence official Anwar Raslan for crimes against humanity including rape.

## Perpetrators and patterns: Strategic versus opportunistic violence

### State forces emerge as major perpetrators contrary to assumptions

USIP research reveals "state armed forces are the major perpetrators"—a finding that challenges common assumptions focusing on rebel groups. Quantitative reviews from 1989-2015 found rebel groups had 40% perpetration rates versus 60% for state forces. However, civilian perpetration is also significant: Harvard research documented a **17-fold increase in civilian-perpetrated rape** in Eastern Congo between 2004-2008, and in DRC overall, 81% of child sexual abuse perpetrators were civilians known to the family.

Research by Dara Kay Cohen at Harvard found gang rape serves to establish group cohesiveness and individual status—"perpetrators experience increased mutual esteem, rape serves as an act of camaraderie." This "combatant socialization" model explains why abductees, feeling frightened and isolated, may participate in group violence to establish belonging.

### The "weapon of war" framing has limitations

UN Resolution 1820 (2008) recognized CRSV as "a tactic of war and threat to international peace and security." Evidence from Bosnia (orders to "plant the seed of Serbs") and Rwanda (political leaders ordering mass rapes) supports strategic use. However, academic research by Elisabeth Jean Wood demonstrates critical variation: the LTTE in Sri Lanka perpetrated very little rape despite other atrocities; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shows rape is "very rare" despite other laws of war violations. This variation suggests causes operate at the **armed group level**, not macro-level, and that some armed groups can and do prohibit sexual violence through discipline.

Maria Eriksson Baaz and Maria Stern's DRC research found many rapes occur **spontaneously during patrols or looting**, driven by opportunity and sense of entitlement without higher command endorsement. The framing affects policy: over-emphasis on military perpetrators may discount high levels of intimate partner and civilian-perpetrated violence.

### Women as perpetrators remain rare but documented

The **Abu Ghraib** scandal showed female soldiers (Lynndie England, Sabrina Harman) participating in detainee abuse. In Rwanda, **Pauline Nyiramasuhuko**, former Minister of Family and Women's Affairs, became the **first woman charged with genocidal rape** at an international court, receiving life imprisonment in 2011 for ordering subordinates including her son to commit rape. Sierra Leone population-based survey data found **one in four reported gang rapes involved female perpetrators**. Laura Sjoberg's 2016 book *Women as Wartime Rapists* documented cases across conflicts, arguing gendered assumptions render female perpetrators "invisible."

---

## Consequences: Physical, psychological, and intergenerational devastation

### Physical health effects include HIV weaponization and fistula

Rwanda demonstrated deliberate HIV transmission: two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 genocide widows tested HIV-positive. In DRC, HIV prevalence in eastern regions quadrupled from 5% (1997) to 20% (2002). At least **5% of sexually assaulted women in DRC develop fistulas**—traumatic fistulas from gang rape and object insertion cause permanent incontinence leading to severe social isolation. Forced pregnancies produced an estimated **2,000-25,000 children** in Rwanda and **2,000-4,000** in Bosnia.

### Psychological trauma shows distinctive patterns

Meta-analysis by Dworkin et al. (2021) found **74.58% of sexual assault survivors** met PTSD criteria at one month post-assault, with **41.49%** still meeting criteria at 12 months. DRC studies show PTSD prevalence ranging from 12-76% depending on exposure, depression 44-68%, and suicide attempts at **33% among rape survivors**. WWII sexual violence survivors reported greater severity of PTSD-related symptoms compared to non-sexual war trauma survivors, with 80.9% reporting severe lifetime sexual problems versus 19% of non-sexual trauma survivors.

### Social consequences create cycles of marginalization

Children born of rape face infanticide, abandonment, statelessness, and discrimination across all conflict contexts. Research in Uganda found children from LRA captivity stated "war was better than peace" due to peacetime marginalization. In Rwanda, children born of rape are **not entitled to relief assistance** under survivor fund laws. Stigmatization remains central to survivors' experiences—in DRC, only 1 in 30 victims officially report, with 75% declining to report in medical settings due to shame. Male survivors frequently face spousal abandonment and community rejection.

## Conclusion: Critical gaps between documentation and accountability

The empirical record on sexual violence in armed conflict reveals a profound paradox: documentation capabilities have improved dramatically since the 1990s, yet accountability and prevention remain deeply inadequate. The 50% surge in verified cases in 2023 reflects both genuine increase in some conflicts and improved reporting mechanisms—but with **10-20 actual cases per registered case** by UNFPA estimates, the true scale remains unknown.

Three critical findings emerge from this synthesis. First, **male victimization has been systematically undercounted**: Ukraine's documentation that 70% of verified CRSV victims are men challenges decades of assumptions and reveals a massive recognition gap requiring restructured response frameworks. Second, **peacetime military sexual assault remains endemic across NATO militaries**, with reporting rates declining and retaliation against reporters documented at 64% in US forces. Third, **accountability mechanisms have failed at scale**: the ICC has secured only two final sexual violence convictions (Ntaganda 2019, Ongwen 2021) in over two decades, while UN peacekeeping maintains an estimated >90% impunity rate.

Poland's trajectory from communist-era suppression of Soviet mass rape to Tier 1 trafficking response status in 2024 illustrates that progress is possible—but requires confronting historical silence, developing survivor-centered services, and maintaining vigilance against new vulnerabilities. The continued absence of comprehensive data on sexual violence in the Polish Armed Forces, while neighboring NATO allies have conducted detailed surveys, represents an unresolved gap. The Ukraine conflict has produced unprecedented documentation, potential ICC prosecution, and survivor-centered approaches—offering a possible model for future conflicts, if institutional capacity can match documented need.
