# The Social Contract of Gender: Historical Evidence Challenging Dominant Narratives

**Both traditional gender arrangements and their reform emerged from negotiated agreements between the sexes, with significant support and opposition crossing gender lines.** Historical evidence reveals that women actively co-created, enforced, and often defended "patriarchal" social structures, while men were among the earliest and most influential theorists of women's liberation. This challenges the simplified narrative of patriarchy as male imposition on unwilling women, and feminism as women's revolt against unified male oppression. The reality appears more complex: gender arrangements functioned as implicit social contracts with distinct trade-offs, and the primary conflict occurred within rather than between the sexes.

## Women organized against suffrage in numbers that rivaled or exceeded pro-suffrage movements

The scale of female anti-suffrage activism represents one of history's most overlooked phenomena. **More American women organized against their own right to vote than in favor of it until 1916.** The National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS), founded in 1911 by Josephine Jewell Dodge, peaked at approximately **350,000-500,000 members by 1919**, making it a formidable political force organized across 25 states.

In Britain, the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League launched in 1908 with novelist Mrs. Humphry Ward as founding president and the famed explorer Gertrude Bell—the first woman to earn first-class honours at Oxford—as honorary secretary. By June 1909, the League had **15,000 paying members and 110 branches**, eventually gathering **337,018 petition signatures** against women's suffrage. These were not marginal figures; they represented a substantial organized opposition led primarily by educated, accomplished women.

The "Appeal Against Female Suffrage" published in *The Nineteenth Century* journal in June 1889 offers a window into female anti-suffrage reasoning. Written by Mrs. Ward with 104 prominent women initially signing (eventually reaching 2,000 signatures), the Appeal argued: "We believe that the emancipating process has now reached the limits fixed by the physical constitution of women" and "We are convinced that the pursuit of mere outward equality with men is for women not only vain but demoralizing."

The class composition of anti-suffrage leadership proves particularly revealing. Female leaders were "generally women of wealth, privilege, social status and even political power," as historian Corrine McConnaughy documented. These society women had personal access to powerful politicians and feared that universal suffrage would dilute their influence. Many argued that women's moral authority derived precisely from their position outside corrupt politics—entering the political arena would contaminate the very purity that gave their influence legitimacy.

## Anti-suffrage women articulated a coherent cost-benefit analysis

The arguments women made against their own enfranchisement reveal sophisticated strategic thinking rather than mere false consciousness. Their reasoning centered on perceived trade-offs that would be disrupted by political equality.

Violet Markham, a prominent anti-suffragist, declared at Albert Hall: "We believe that men and women are different—not similar—beings, with talents that are complementary, not identical, and that they therefore ought to have different shares in the management of the State." This "complementary difference" argument held that women already possessed significant domestic and moral power that direct political participation would diminish.

An NAOWS pamphlet enumerated the perceived benefits women would sacrifice: "Special privileges to women including the right to be supported by their husbands or fathers, exemption from military service and jury duty, and first dibs on the lifeboats." The pamphlet bluntly warned: "If women became more like men in their public roles it would threaten their existing 'special privileges.'"

Anti-suffragist women also cited practical political concerns. Mrs. Humphry Ward wrote in *The Times* on February 27, 1909: "Women's suffrage is a more dangerous leap in the dark than it was in the 1860s because of the vast growth of the Empire, the immense increase of England's imperial responsibilities... constitutional, legal, financial, military, international problems—problems of men, only to be solved by the labour and special knowledge of men."

Even suffragist leader Carrie Chapman Catt acknowledged in 1920 that "only about a third of women supported suffrage, another third was opposed, and the rest didn't care." The division was not men versus women but, as suffragist Alice Stone Blackwell described it, "broad-minded men and women on the one side against narrow-minded men and women on the other."

## Women enforced traditional practices on other women across cultures

Beyond organized political opposition, historical evidence shows women actively enforcing traditional gender arrangements through social pressure, physical practices, and intergenerational transmission.

The **White Feather Campaign** during World War I offers a striking example of women wielding gender norms as weapons—against men. Launched in August 1914 in Folkestone, England, the campaign rapidly spread across Britain and to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Author Emma Orczy (of *The Scarlet Pimpernel* fame) founded the Women of England's Active Service League, enrolling **20,000 women** who pledged to "persuade every man I know to offer his service" and "never to be seen in public with any man who has refused to respond to his country's call."

Women combed streets, trams, and theaters pinning white feathers of cowardice on men not in uniform. Scholar Nicoletta Gullace notes that "for women, some of whom had probably been subject to harassment from men as they travelled on trams, the opportunity to harass and shame men in return must have been somewhat tempting." The campaign proved effective—many men "volunteered soon after being handed a feather, unable to bear the stigma." The government was forced to issue special badges for essential workers and veterans to protect them from this female-administered shaming.

**Foot-binding in China** presents another case of female enforcement. Researchers Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates, interviewing thousands of elderly rural Chinese women, concluded footbinding was "nearly universal among inland Han women born before 1910." Crucially, "mothers, grandmothers, or other older female relatives" performed the binding. It was "considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain." The practice was transmitted from mother to daughter for over a millennium.

Women's motivations were practical, not merely traditional. A Yunnan woman explained: "If my feet were not bound, I could not have married. And then, what kind of life would I have had?" Scholars argue binding functioned as "an instrumental means to reserve women to handwork" and "a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork, and keep them close at hand"—strategies for keeping daughters economically useful while maximizing marriage prospects.

**Female genital cutting** in Africa follows similar patterns of female enforcement. The UNFPA reports that FGM "is typically carried out by elderly people in the community (usually, but not exclusively, women)." Female elders designated for this task perform procedures and transmit the practice across generations. Scholar Fuambai Ahmadu observes: "Women are the organizers, the champions, and staunch defenders of these practices and, importantly they strategically manipulate and exploit gender ideologies."

The 1956 Ngaitana Movement in Kenya proved particularly revealing. When male elders (Njuri Nchecke) banned FGM in Meru, **thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades** over three years in defiance. Called "Ngaitana" ("I will circumcise myself"), the movement demonstrated that, as historian Lynn Thomas notes, it "made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators."

## Male theorists pioneered feminist philosophy decades before organized women's movements

The intellectual architecture of feminist thought was substantially designed by men. **Charles Fourier** is widely credited with coining the term "féminisme" around 1837 and articulating the principle that "the extension of women's privileges is the general principle for all social progress." His 1808 *Théorie des Quatre Mouvements* argued that "the level of development of any civilization could be determined by the extent to which its women were liberated."

**The Marquis de Condorcet** published "On the Admission of Women to the Rights of Citizenship" in July 1790—two years before Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Woman*. Condorcet argued: "The rights of men follow only from the fact that they are feeling beings, capable of acquiring moral ideas and of reasoning about these ideas. Since women have the same qualities, they necessarily have equal rights." His argument was more politically radical than Wollstonecraft's focus on education; Condorcet explicitly demanded suffrage.

**William Thompson's** 1825 "Appeal of One Half the Human Race" stands as "the first detailed statement of socialist feminism," according to scholar Dolores Dooley. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls it "one of the classics of early nineteenth-century feminist literature." Thompson championed political and civil rights for women, advocating for equitable laws, educational opportunities, and marriage reform.

**John Stuart Mill** remains the most influential male feminist theorist. His 1869 "The Subjection of Women" declared: "The principle which regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes—the legal subordination of one sex to the other—is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement." Mill drew a stark comparison: "No slave is a slave to the same lengths, and in so full a sense of the word, as a wife is."

On **May 20, 1867**, Mill presented Parliament's first women's suffrage amendment, proposing to replace "man" with "person" in the Reform Bill. Though defeated **196 to 73**, Mill considered it "perhaps the only really important public service I performed in the capacity of a Member of Parliament." This sparked continuous parliamentary campaigns; suffrage bills appeared almost annually from 1870 onward.

**Friedrich Engels'** 1884 "Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" provided Marxist feminism's theoretical foundation, arguing that women's oppression arose with private property. Engels wrote that "the modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife" and that monogamous marriage developed primarily to ensure legitimate heirs for property transmission.

**Frederick Douglass** attended the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention as the only African American present, making "a powerful speech" supporting women's suffrage and signing the Declaration of Sentiments. He later wrote in *The North Star*: "There can be no reason in the world for denying to woman the exercise of the elective franchise... Our doctrine is, that 'Right is of no sex.'" Douglass self-identified as "a woman's-rights-man" and called the suffrage movement "one of the most sublime undertakings" in history.

## Male legislators in all-male parliaments voted to enfranchise women

Every suffrage law in history was passed by legislatures where women had no representation. This fact—that men voted to share political power with women—deserves analytical attention.

In **New Zealand** (1893), male politicians including former Premier Sir John Hall, Premier Julius Vogel, and Sir Robert Stout championed women's suffrage. The Electoral Bill passed the Legislative Council **20-18** on September 8, 1893, making New Zealand the first self-governing country to grant women national voting rights. Ironically, Premier Richard Seddon actively opposed suffrage, but two councillors switched their votes specifically to embarrass him, demonstrating that political maneuvering—not unified male opposition—determined outcomes.

In the **United Kingdom**, John Stuart Mill's 1867 amendment attracted 75 supporters including 12 Conservatives. The Men's League for Women's Suffrage (1907) and Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement (1910) organized male allies. The 1918 Representation of the People Act passed the House of Commons **224 to 114**—with many male MPs having personally experienced women's wartime contributions. Labour leader Keir Hardie regularly questioned ministers on suffragette prisoners; George Lansbury MP resigned his seat to fight a by-election on the suffrage question.

In the **United States**, Senator Aaron Sargent introduced what became the Susan B. Anthony Amendment on January 10, 1878. The final votes showed significant male support: the House passed the amendment **304-89** on May 21, 1919, and the Senate approved it **56-25** on June 4, 1919. **Harry T. Burn**, the 24-year-old Tennessee legislator, cast the decisive vote for ratification on August 18, 1920, breaking a tie—reportedly influenced by his mother's letter urging him to vote yes.

Male motivations varied. Some acted from genuine ideological commitment to equality. Others calculated political advantage—parties worried which way women would vote. War recognition played a role; even former opponent Prime Minister Asquith admitted: "How could we have carried on the war without them?" Some historians argue fear of social unrest motivated the 1918 UK act: "Combination of the revolution in Russia, the rise of the Labour Party and continued suffragette activity convinced a majority of politicians that the current voting system needed to be overhauled if a socialist revolution was to be avoided."

## Marriage law reveals explicit contractual structure with mutual obligations

Legal historians confirm that traditional marriage functioned as an explicit contract with binding obligations on both parties. William Blackstone's *Commentaries on the Laws of England* (1765-1769) established that "the husband is bound to provide his wife with necessaries by law, as much as himself."

**Coverture** involved a two-way exchange. Women surrendered independent legal identity, property ownership, and contracting rights. In return, husbands assumed complete financial liability. Men were obligated to pay for wives' debts contracted for necessities—even against express wishes. If husbands failed to provide, wives could purchase necessaries on their credit. Courts deemed fur coats, gold watches, and expensive furniture "necessaries" depending on the couple's circumstances. The Doctrine of Necessaries, developed "more than three centuries ago," was "a woman's only legal means of enforcing her husband's obligation to support her."

Breach of contract had consequences for both parties. If husbands failed to provide, wives had legal recourse through courts. If wives "eloped and lived with another man," husbands were released from provision obligations. Divorce entitled women to alimony—an allowance from husband's estate. Widows received dower rights to one-third of husband's property.

Turkish scholar **Deniz Kandiyoti** formalized this understanding in her influential 1988 concept of the "patriarchal bargain": "Women strategize within a set of concrete constraints... Different forms of patriarchy present women with distinct 'rules of the game' and call for different strategies to maximize security and optimize life options." She documented that in classic patriarchal systems, junior wives "accepted subservience to their husband and mother-in-law in exchange for economic security and eventual authority over their own daughters-in-law"—a lifecycle trade of early subordination for later power.

Critically, Kandiyoti observed that "under transformative pressures, women often resist changes to the patriarchal status quo, because they do not envisage equivalent or greater benefits than they already receive in return for their patriarchal bargain."

## Both sexes bore asymmetric burdens under traditional arrangements

The social contract framework reveals that traditional arrangements imposed distinct costs on both sexes, not just women.

**Men's obligations** included: sole financial provision regardless of wife's ability to work; liability for wife's debts contracted before and during marriage; military conscription (currently, fewer than a third of countries with military drafts include women; only Norway, Sweden, and Denmark conscript both sexes equally); dangerous occupations (the "women and children first" maritime protocol expected men to sacrifice their lives); and social pressure to provide protection at personal risk.

The **1981 Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg** upheld male-only Selective Service registration, with philosopher David Benatar later arguing in *The Second Sexism* (2012): "The prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary, it is only men who should be conscripted... This is a sexist assumption." Anthropologist Ayse Gül Altinay notes: "Given equal suffrage rights, there is no other citizenship practice that differentiates as radically between men and women as compulsory male conscription."

Contemporary surveys reveal ongoing tensions. A **2025 poll by 19th News/SurveyMonkey** (n=20,807) found **40% of women agree** society would benefit from return to traditional gender roles, versus 58% of men. Pew Research shows **70% of people** consider ability to support family financially "very important" for men to be good partners, versus only 32% saying the same for women. Research across 29 countries confirms that "male-breadwinner norms are a key driver of the association between men's unemployment and the risk of separation."

## Implications for understanding gender history

This evidence suggests several revisions to dominant narratives. First, gender arrangements historically operated as negotiated social contracts with genuine trade-offs, not simple impositions. Women gained economic security, exemption from dangerous obligations, and legal protections in exchange for domestic labor and diminished autonomy. Men gained domestic services and social authority in exchange for financial liability and physical risk obligations.

Second, both "patriarchy" and "feminism" had mixed-gender coalitions. Substantial numbers of women actively defended traditional arrangements—sometimes more vigorously than men. Male theorists pioneered feminist philosophy and male legislators ultimately voted to share political power. The conflict was always within sexes as much as between them.

Third, changes to gender arrangements often served interests of both sexes. Men escaping sole-provider obligations, employers accessing expanded labor pools, and political parties calculating electoral advantage all contributed to reform movements. Women's liberation was never purely women's project against unified male opposition.

Fourth, contemporary evidence shows persistent preference heterogeneity. Significant minorities of women prefer traditional arrangements when economically feasible, while many men seek to escape traditional breadwinner obligations. The "gender revolution" remains incomplete precisely because preferences remain genuinely divided—within each sex.

This framework does not suggest traditional arrangements were just or that contemporary inequalities are resolved. It does suggest that simplistic narratives of male domination and female victimhood obscure a more complex history of negotiation, trade-offs, and strategic choice by both sexes within constrained circumstances. Understanding gender history as social contract rather than simple oppression may illuminate paths toward arrangements that better serve the diverse preferences of both men and women today.
