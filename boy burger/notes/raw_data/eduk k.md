# Educational inequalities facing women and girls persist despite overall academic gains

Women now outperform men across most educational metrics globally, yet **critical disadvantages persist** in STEM fields, academic leadership, and certain regions. In Poland, women represent **57.6%** of university students but hold only **27%** of full professorships—a "leaky pipeline" that loses women at each career stage. The STEM gender gap remains stubborn: just **17%** of ICT students in Poland are female. Meanwhile, **122 million girls** remain out of school globally, with Afghanistan being the only country explicitly banning girls from secondary education. Perhaps most paradoxically, more gender-egalitarian countries show **larger** STEM gender gaps—a phenomenon researchers are still working to explain.

## A. Poland: From underground education to university majority

### Historical milestones: Women's long path to academic access

Polish women's journey to educational equality spans centuries of resistance and gradual progress. The Jagiellonian University, founded in **1364**, remained exclusively male for over 500 years. According to legend, Nawojka disguised herself as a man to attend lectures around **1407**—possibly the first Polish female student.

The breakthrough came through Austria's partition territory. In **1866**, women in Galicia gained limited university access (excluding law). The **Flying University** (Uniwersytet Latający), established in **1882** in Warsaw, provided clandestine education to women during Russian partition—this underground institution famously launched Marie Skłodowska-Curie's scientific journey.

**Key Polish milestones for women's university access:**

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1875 | Stefania Wolicka becomes first Polish woman to earn PhD (Zürich, History) |
| 1894 | Jagiellonian University Senate permits women to attend lectures |
| 1897 | Over 100 women formally enter Jagiellonian University |
| 1902 | First woman completes doctoral examination at Jagiellonian |
| 1906 | Women permitted to hold academic positions at Jagiellonian |
| 1918 | Polish independence brings legal access to all universities |
| 1920 | Formal path to university careers opens to women |

The interwar period (1918–1939) saw only **40 women** receive habilitations across all Polish universities, with some institutions even proposing quotas against women similar to restrictions on Jewish students.

### The academic glass ceiling: From 58% students to 27% professors

Modern Poland exhibits a dramatic "scissors effect" in academia. Women dominate as students but face systematic attrition through their careers.

**The leaky pipeline in Polish academia (2019–2023):**

| Career Level | Women (%) |
|-------------|-----------|
| University students | 57.6% |
| Postgraduate studies | 70.5% |
| PhD candidates | ~48-50% |
| Academic positions (overall) | 45% |
| Senior academic positions | 40% |
| Full professors | **27%** |
| STEM professorships | ~18.3% |
| Full professors in STEM | ~10% |

The drop-offs concentrate at two critical junctures: the transition from PhD to postdoctoral positions, and between habilitation and full professorship. Research documents a significant "motherhood penalty" during the decade between PhD completion and habilitation.

Leadership positions reveal an even starker picture. Since 1990, women have served as university rectors in just **1 of every 45 terms** at comprehensive Polish universities. At Warsaw University, only **6 of 21 deans** are women, and female full professors number **156 compared to 347 men**. The gender pay gap in academia reaches **27.7%** at managerial positions, despite Poland's relatively small unadjusted overall gap of 7–9%.

### STEM fields: A tale of two disciplines

Poland actually leads the EU in female STEM graduates, with **41.5%** of STEM degrees earned by women in 2021—well above the EU average of **32.8%**. The country is one of only four EU nations where women exceed 40% of STEM graduates. Women represent **65–70%** of mathematics graduates specifically, among the highest rates in Europe.

However, computer science tells a different story. Only **17%** of ICT tertiary students are female, and women account for just **17.5%** of ICT professionals. PISA 2018 revealed that only **1%** of Polish girls expected to work in ICT professions compared to **19%** of boys.

**Female representation by STEM field in Poland:**

| Field | Women (%) | Trend |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Mathematics graduates | 65-70% | Highest in EU |
| STEM tertiary students | 34.1% | Above EU average (32.3%) |
| STEM graduates | 41.5% | Among EU highest |
| Engineering/architecture graduates | 42% | Highest in EU |
| ICT students | 17% | Below EU average (~21%) |
| ICT PhD students | 20.7% | Below EU average (24.3%) |

The "Girls to Universities of Technology!" campaign, running since 2008, has increased female STEM participation from **29% to 37%** over 14 years.

### Vocational education: Deep gender segregation persists

Only **38.1%** of upper secondary vocational graduates are female—among the smallest shares in OECD countries. The segregation is extreme: less than **1%** of women in basic vocational schools study engineering and related trades, while women dominate education, health, and welfare tracks.

The consequences are stark. Women with vocational education face a **30.8%** NEET rate (not in employment, education, or training) at ages 25–29, compared to just **7%** for men with equivalent credentials. For women without upper secondary education, the NEET rate reaches a devastating **69.1%**.

### Textbooks and teacher bias: Systematic stereotyping documented

Professor Iwona Chmura-Rutkowska's three-volume study "Gender w podręcznikach" (2015–2016) found gender inequalities and stereotypical portrayals in **virtually every school book** analyzed across all subjects and education levels. Women appeared primarily as mothers and housewives; men as breadwinners. History textbooks rendered women nearly invisible.

A 2022 follow-up study published in *PLoS ONE* confirmed that **little has changed** despite curriculum reforms. Researchers observing 204 hours of classroom instruction across 17 schools found teachers—though aware of stereotypes—**systematically reinforced rather than challenged them**. Boys received more attention (even negative), were encouraged toward competition, while girls were steered toward cooperation. Teacher awareness of biased textbook content was described as "negligible."

### Sexual harassment: 30–40% of students affected

Multiple studies reveal widespread harassment in Polish educational institutions:

- **40.7%** of students experienced harassment during studies (Polish Ombudsman 2017)
- **44.8%** of female students received unwanted comments about their bodies or private lives
- Nearly **10%** of female students experienced sexual violence
- **29%** of harassment cases involved academic staff as perpetrators
- Only **9%** of victims/witnesses reported incidents to university authorities

At the school level, **18%** of primary students and **7%** of upper secondary students reported sexual aggression. Most Polish universities lack dedicated harassment procedures, though Warsaw University adopted the first Gender Equality Plan in 2020.

### Rural-urban divide: A 30-percentage-point gap

The urban-rural educational divide in Poland is dramatic. Among 25–34-year-olds, **62.3%** in urban areas hold tertiary degrees compared to only **32%** in rural areas—nearly half the rate. This 30+ percentage point gap significantly limits opportunities for rural girls despite their overall educational advantage.

## B. European Union: Finland as outlier, persistent STEM gaps

### PISA 2022 reveals math gap against girls remains stubborn

Across OECD countries, boys outperform girls in mathematics by **9 points** on average—a gap unchanged from 2018. Austria and Italy show the widest EU gaps at **15+ points** against girls. At the top of the distribution, the gap widens: in Israel, Italy, and the USA, the highest-performing boys exceed highest-performing girls by **30+ points**.

**Finland stands alone** as the only country with above-OECD-average math scores where girls outperform boys. In reading, girls lead boys by **24 points** on average across all OECD countries—a consistent advantage in every EU nation.

**PISA 2022 gender gaps by domain:**

| Domain | Average Gap | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Mathematics | 9 points | Boys lead | Unchanged 2018–2022 |
| Reading | 24 points | Girls lead | Universal across EU |
| Science | No significant difference | — | Small variation by country |

### STEM graduates: Eastern Europe leads, Western lags

Romania tops the EU with **42.5%** female STEM graduates, followed by Poland (**41.5%**) and Greece (**40.9%**). Western European nations cluster at the bottom: Belgium (**27.4%**), Germany and Spain (**27.7%**), and Austria (**28%**).

Yet in ICT specifically, Eastern Europe also leads—Bulgaria has **29.1%** female ICT specialists, followed by Estonia (**26.8%**) and Romania (**26%**). Czechia trails at **12.4%**. The EU average stands at **19.4%**, with men comprising **80%** of total ICT graduates.

Interestingly, countries with highest female STEM graduation rates often score lower on overall gender equality indices—an aspect of the "gender equality paradox."

### Women professors: The glass ceiling index across Europe

The EU-27 average for female full professors reached approximately **29.4%** in 2022. The She Figures 2024 Glass Ceiling Index—where 1.0 represents equal access and higher values indicate greater barriers—reveals significant variation:

| Country | Glass Ceiling Index | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| EU Average | 1.40 | Moderate barriers |
| Cyprus | 2.54 | Highest barriers |
| Hungary | 1.86 | High barriers |
| Portugal | 1.74 | High barriers |
| Poland | 1.61 | Moderate barriers |

The "leaky pipeline" is consistent across Europe: women comprise **48%** of PhD students but only **30%** of full professors and **26%** of research institution heads. Norway leads with **41%** female rectors; Italy and Czech Republic trail at under **10%**.

### Vocational education shows extreme segregation

Gender segregation in vocational training exceeds general education throughout Europe. Only **15.5%** of STEM vocational students are female—far below the 2030 EU target of **25%**. The segregation by field is stark:

- **Education**: 96.3% women
- **Welfare**: 86.6% women
- **ICT**: 2.5% women
- **Engineering**: 7.1% women
- **Architecture/construction**: 12.6% women

Austria shows the widest gap with only **8.1%** women in STEM vocational training. Ireland is the sole EU country where more women than men enroll in vocational education overall.

### Country rankings: Nordic leaders, Southeastern laggards

The EIGE Gender Equality Index 2024 places Sweden first with a score of **82**, followed by Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland. The EU average is **71**. Romania scores lowest at **56.1**, with Hungary (**~58**) and Greece (**~57**) also trailing. Progress remains slow: gender parity in the EU is estimated **67 years away** at current rates.

## C. Global extremes: From denial of education to female advantage

### Afghanistan: The world's only country banning girls from secondary education

Afghanistan under Taliban rule represents the most severe denial of girls' education anywhere in the world. Since August 2021, **2.5 million girls** (80% of school-age girls) have been denied their right to education. Specific restrictions include:

- Girls banned from school beyond grade 6
- Women barred from universities (December 2022)
- University enrollment dropped **53%** since 2021
- December 2024: Taliban banned women from nursing and midwifery training
- Female teachers prohibited from teaching boys

No other country explicitly bans girls from secondary and higher education. UNESCO has deployed over 1,000 facilitators providing literacy courses to 57,000+ young people across 2,600+ villages.

### Global out-of-school crisis: 122 million girls affected

UNESCO's 2024 data reveals **251 million children and youth** remain out of school globally, with **122 million girls** among them. The population concentrates in Central/Southern Asia (34%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (39%). Countries with lowest female education access include:

| Country | Girls Out of School | Key Issue |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| South Sudan | 76% primary | Conflict, newest nation |
| Afghanistan | 55% primary, 74% secondary | Taliban ban |
| Chad | 53% primary | Cultural traditions |
| Niger | 68% secondary | 76% child marriage rate |
| Central African Republic | 55% secondary | 1 teacher per 80 pupils |

In Nigeria, **60%** of 10 million out-of-school children are girls. More than half of the world's out-of-school children live in Sub-Saharan Africa.

### Child marriage: 87% of married adolescent girls leave school

Globally, **12 million girls** in low- and middle-income countries marry before age 18 annually. The educational impact is severe: **87%** of married adolescent girls aged 15–17 are no longer in school. Niger has the highest rate at **76%** child marriage.

The relationship is bidirectional: each additional year of secondary education reduces the likelihood of child marriage by **6 percentage points**. In Nepal, married girls are **10 times more likely** to drop out than unmarried peers.

### Latin America: World leader in female educational advantage

Latin America and the Caribbean have achieved and surpassed gender parity, with **more than 60%** of women attending college versus less than half of men. Panama achieved female advantage first in 1973, followed by Uruguay (1979), Argentina (1989), and Mexico (2016). The region inverted its gender gap in tertiary education in 1993—one year before the EU and eight years before the global average.

Girls complete upper secondary at **68.7%** versus **61.5%** for boys. In most LAC countries, boys now face higher repetition and dropout rates—the so-called "reverse gender gap."

### Nobel Prizes: Women remain dramatically underrepresented

Only **67 women** have received Nobel Prizes since 1901—approximately **6–7%** of all laureates. Marie Curie remains the only woman to win twice (Physics 1903, Chemistry 1911). The distribution by field reveals the science gap:

| Category | Women Winners | % of Total |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Peace | 20 | 16.3% |
| Literature | 18 | 15.0% |
| Physiology/Medicine | 14 | 5.6% |
| Chemistry | 8 | 4.1% |
| Physics | 5 | **1.8%** |
| Economic Sciences | 3 | 2.2% |

Progress is accelerating: **35 women** have won since 2001—more than double the entire 20th century total. The 2023 awards saw four female laureates including Claudia Goldin as the first solo female winner in Economics.

**Historical university access milestones:**

| Year | Country/Institution | Milestone |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1237 | University of Bologna | First woman attends university (Bettisia Gozzadini) |
| 1678 | University of Padua | First woman receives PhD (Elena Cornaro Piscopia) |
| 1837 | Oberlin College, USA | First coeducational college |
| 1878 | University of London | First UK university to award degrees to women |
| 1920 | Oxford | Women admitted as full members |
| **1948** | Cambridge | Women finally allowed degrees |

## D. Paradoxes and nuances: Why advantages don't translate to equality

### The gender equality paradox in STEM confounds expectations

Stoet and Geary's influential 2018 study in *Psychological Science* (n=472,242) revealed a counterintuitive finding: **countries with greater gender equality show larger STEM gender gaps**. In nearly all countries studied, more girls appeared capable of college-level STEM than actually enrolled—but this gap widened as the Global Gender Gap Index increased.

Proposed explanations include the "economic security hypothesis"—in wealthy, egalitarian countries, individuals can afford to follow interests rather than maximize earnings through STEM. Additionally, girls' relative strength is typically reading while boys' is math/science; these patterns may amplify when external pressures diminish.

A 2020 replication attempt by Richardson et al. at Harvard raised methodological concerns, though the overall correlation held. UNESCO's 2019 report confirmed a similar "ICT gender equality paradox."

### The confidence gap: Girls underestimate abilities even when outperforming

Research consistently shows girls report lower math self-efficacy despite equal or superior grades. A 2024 University of Zurich study found boys overestimate their abilities regardless of actual performance, while **girls accurately assess their abilities** based on grades. In challenging math contexts, boys rate their ability **27% higher** than identically talented girls.

**Teacher perception accounts for 50%** of the gender gap in children's math ability self-concept. From first grade onward, teachers underrate girls' math skills even with equal achievement and behavioral ratings.

### Stereotype threat: Documented but debated

Claude Steele's foundational research (Spencer, Steele & Quinn, 1999) demonstrated that when women were told a math test "produces gender differences," they performed significantly worse than equally qualified men. When told the test showed "no gender differences," the gap disappeared.

Over **200 published experiments** have replicated the effect, though meta-analyses find varying effect sizes (d=0.22 to 0.48). Critics note that only **30%** of unconfounded experiments replicated original findings, and some large studies found no effect in school-age girls. The phenomenon likely requires specific conditions: domain identification, diagnostic framing, and difficult tasks.

### Why math-capable girls avoid STEM careers

Research using 300,000+ students across 64 countries reveals that girls who excel at math **also excel at reading**—giving them broader comparative advantages. Boys show the opposite pattern. When researchers adjusted for girls' verbal advantage, the STEM gender gap nearly disappeared.

The implication: math-capable women don't avoid STEM due to inability but because they have more options. Expectancy-value theory (Eccles, 1983) explains that career choices depend on both perceived success probability and subjective task values—interest, utility, and cost.

### The reversal: Boys now falling behind

The historical irony is stark. Women fought for university access for over 500 years; by 2003, the US had **1.35 females for every male** graduating from four-year colleges. Girls' high school GPA mode shifted from "B" to "A" while boys remained at "B." Girls' expectations for graduate school doubled (10%→21%) while boys' increased by half (10%→15%).

The OECD confirmed in 2015 that boys are less likely to attain basic proficiency, invest less time and effort, and express more negative attitudes toward school. Yet this reversal doesn't negate persistent female disadvantages in STEM fields, academic leadership, and career advancement—the domains where structural barriers rather than individual performance determine outcomes.

## Conclusion

Three central tensions define contemporary gender and education. First, the "scissors effect": women's academic dominance (57% of university students) coexists with dramatic underrepresentation in academic leadership (27% of professors) and STEM careers (17% of ICT professionals). Second, geography creates stark divides—Poland's 30-percentage-point urban-rural gap mirrors the global chasm between Latin America (60%+ female college enrollment) and Afghanistan (2.5 million girls denied education). Third, the paradoxes remain unresolved: more egalitarian societies produce larger STEM gaps, and girls who outperform boys report lower confidence in the same subjects.

Research on stereotype threat, textbook bias, and teacher expectations provides mechanisms explaining why structural advantages don't automatically translate to field-specific equality. The "leaky pipeline" loses women not through random attrition but at predictable junctures—particularly the PhD-to-postdoc transition and the period between habilitation and professorship when caregiving responsibilities peak. Poland's documented prevalence of classroom stereotyping and sexual harassment (30–40% of students affected) suggests that beyond access, the quality and safety of educational environments require urgent attention.

The evidence points toward multifaceted interventions: addressing the confidence gap through changed pedagogical approaches, reforming textbooks that 2022 research confirms still portray women primarily as mothers and housewives, establishing harassment reporting mechanisms that the **91%** of non-reporting victims might actually use, and examining why vocational education channels girls away from technical fields with better employment outcomes. The reversal in overall educational achievement does not obviate these specific disadvantages—it makes them more puzzling and, perhaps, more addressable.
