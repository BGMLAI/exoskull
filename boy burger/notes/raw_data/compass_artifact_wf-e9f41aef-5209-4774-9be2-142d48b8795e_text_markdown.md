# Gender differences in children's activities: What science reveals about nature, nurture, and outcomes

The gender gap in children's activities is both substantial and nuanced—boys and girls diverge most dramatically in physical play, video gaming, and domestic work, while showing minimal differences in social media use. Large-scale studies consistently find effect sizes of **d > 1.0** for toy preferences and **10-28 percentage point gaps** in sports and dance participation, yet these differences emerge through a complex interplay of biological predispositions and powerful socialization forces. The "gender equality paradox"—where more egalitarian societies show *larger* gender gaps in interests—suggests that removing social barriers may allow underlying preferences to emerge more fully, though stereotype amplification also plays a role. Interventions can be effective: female role models increase girls' STEM interest by **20-30%**, but heavy-handed approaches risk backlash, particularly for boys.

## Leisure time reveals stark patterns across screens, sports, and reading

The EU Kids Online study of **25,101 children** across 19 European countries documents that video gaming is the most strongly gendered activity: boys play daily at approximately **twice the rate of girls** (59% vs. 29% on average), with gaps reaching 54 percentage points in some nations. In contrast, social media use shows little gender difference across most countries, though girls report using platforms more for emotional bonding and appearance validation while boys emphasize competitive activity.

Physical activity gaps are equally pronounced. HBSC data from 36 countries finds only **25% of boys and 15% of girls** meet WHO recommendations for daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The International Children Accelerometry Database (15,461 participants, 9 countries) confirms boys are consistently more active across all nations. A Canadian study found boys spend **8.6 versus 6.8 hours weekly** in outdoor play—a statistically significant 1.8-hour gap that persists across socioeconomic levels. German playground research revealed girls' physical activity is suppressed in the presence of boys, with opposite-sex presence being a significant negative predictor of girls' movement intensity.

Reading for pleasure shows the reverse pattern. PIRLS 2021 data from 57 countries finds fourth-grade girls outperform boys by an average of **16-18 points** (approximately d = 0.15-0.16), with this gap widening through adolescence to 27 points by age 15 on PISA assessments. Girls also dominate arts participation: English survey data shows **41% of girls versus 13% of boys** aged 5-10 participate in dance, with gaps widening to 56% versus 17% among 11-15 year-olds.

**Polish data** specifically reveals traditional patterns persist: Statistics Poland's 2023 Time Use Survey found women spend **4 hours 27 minutes daily** on unpaid household work versus 3 hours 1 minute for men. Polish girls prefer "fun, pleasure, entertainment" in physical education while boys prefer "exercise, sweat, fitness," reflecting preference patterns that emerge early and track into adulthood.

## Household chores begin shaping gender roles from early childhood

UNICEF's global analysis reveals girls aged 5-14 spend **160 million more hours daily** on unpaid care and domestic work than boys—a gap that widens dramatically with age. India's Time Use Survey shows girls aged 6-14 spend 50% more time on unpaid domestic work than boys, increasing to **80% more by ages 15-17**. In Albania, girls aged 10-14 spend four times longer than boys on domestic tasks (1.5 hours versus less than 30 minutes daily).

The types of chores assigned differ systematically by gender. Girls are channeled toward **routine, daily, indoor tasks** requiring ongoing attention: cooking, cleaning, laundry, dishwashing, and caring for younger siblings. Boys receive **intermittent, occasional, outdoor tasks** that can be delayed: yard work, taking out trash, vehicle maintenance, and repairs. Pew Research finds teenage girls spend twice as much time on cleaning and food preparation as boys (29 versus 12 minutes daily), while BusyKid app data reveals boys are paid **more than double** what girls earn for chores ($13.80 versus $6.71 weekly).

Cross-national comparisons show striking variation. Eurostat data finds the gender gap in daily housework ranges from **47 minutes in Norway** to **3 hours 16 minutes in Turkey**. Poland exhibits among the highest female food management participation at 91%, compared to 70% in Norway. The Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study (7,966 children tracked from ages 9 to 13) found gender inequalities in domestic chores exist by age 9 and become **even greater by age 13**.

These early patterns predict adult outcomes. The University of Minnesota's longitudinal research identified participation in household tasks beginning at ages 3-4 as the **single best predictor** of young adults' success in their mid-twenties, controlling for socioeconomic status and family structure. The NLSY79 cohort study found men who cared for younger siblings as teenagers were more likely to favor women's employment and believe men and women should share housework—suggesting early caregiving experiences shape lifelong attitudes.

## Extracurricular participation reveals persistent gender typing despite narrowing gaps

Sports participation shows a 4 percentage point gap favoring boys in the United States (56% versus 52% for ages 6-17), but gaps widen dramatically in adolescence and vary by sport type. HBSC data from 44 European countries finds only **25% of boys and 15% of girls** meet daily physical activity recommendations—a 10 percentage point gap that is largest in Spain (14 points) and smallest in Scandinavian countries. Sport England reports 64% of girls quit sports by ages 16-17, with 7 in 10 girls citing fear of failure.

Arts participation reverses this pattern. English survey data shows girls lead in music (81% versus 60% among 11-15 year-olds), dance (56% versus 17%), and theatre (76% versus 55%). The dance gap is particularly striking: US NHANES data finds dance accounts for **39.3% of girls' total physical activity** but only 23% for boys.

Academic competitions reveal the most extreme gender gaps. The International Mathematical Olympiad has seen **88% entirely male teams** from the United States since 1974. Gender ratios at high achievement levels are stark: 2:1 boys to girls at the SAT Math 99th percentile, widening to **12:1 at the AMC 99.9th percentile**. These gaps exist despite no systematic advantage for boys on standardized math tests in many countries—and in some nations, girls outperform boys.

Parental investment patterns are complex. Project Play data shows families spend **$228 more annually per sport on girls** than boys, driven by higher costs for female-dominated sports like swimming ($1,033 for girls versus $385 for boys) and travel expenses. However, fathers spend more time with sons than daughters overall, and a Journal of Political Economy study found parents are **28% more likely to choose competition for sons** than daughters—a bias explained by parental beliefs about children's competitiveness preferences.

## Toy preferences emerge early and show robust cross-cultural patterns

The meta-analysis by Davis and Hines (2020) analyzing 113 effect sizes from 75 studies documents that boys' preference for vehicles over dolls yields an effect size of **d = 3.10**, while girls' preference for dolls over vehicles shows **d = 3.51**—among the largest behavioral gender differences documented in psychology. Todd et al.'s (2018) meta-analysis of 16 studies (1,600 children) found these preferences persist regardless of adult presence, study context, geographical location, or child age.

Critically, these preferences emerge before children can be substantially socialized. Studies using visual preference paradigms find gender-typed toy preferences at **3-8 months of age**—before children demonstrate gendered identity (typically 18-24 months). Connellan et al.'s controversial study of newborns found 43% of male newborns looked longer at physical-mechanical mobiles versus 25% at faces, with the pattern reversed for females.

Evidence from congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) provides a natural experiment. Girls with CAH, who experience elevated prenatal androgen exposure, show masculinized toy preferences with effect sizes of **d = 1.34** compared to unaffected sisters—even when parents actively encourage feminine toys. Servin et al. found a dose-response relationship: more severe CAH correlates with more masculine preferences. Primate studies by Alexander and Hines (2002) found male vervet monkeys preferred wheeled toys and balls while females preferred dolls and pots, suggesting evolutionary origins for at least some preference differences.

However, socialization effects are also documented. Woods et al.'s experimental studies found short-term parental encouragement was ineffective at changing preferences, but **toys present in the home predicted later preferences**—suggesting cumulative exposure matters more than explicit encouragement. The Davis and Hines meta-analysis found forced-choice methods (where children must choose in front of experimenters) produced larger effect sizes than free-play methods, indicating social desirability inflates measured differences.

The "gender equality paradox" complicates interpretation. Stoet and Geary's (2018) analysis of **472,242 adolescents** found sex differences in STEM pursuit *increased* with national gender equality—countries with highest gender equality showed largest gender gaps in STEM enrollment. Falk and Hermle's (2018) Science study of 80,000 participants across 76 countries confirmed gender differences in preferences correlate positively with GDP and gender equality indices. However, Breda et al. (2020) argued the paradox could be "entirely explained" by math-male stereotypes being stronger in more egalitarian countries—suggesting cultural rather than biological mechanisms.

## Multiple mechanisms interact to create and maintain gendered patterns

Parental socialization shows surprisingly small effects for general parenting behaviors. Endendijk et al.'s meta-analysis of 126 observational studies (15,034 families) found only **d = 0.08** for differential use of control strategies—essentially negligible. Where parents *do* differentiate substantially is in **encouragement of gender-typed activities**, provision of gender-typed toys and clothing, and emotion socialization. Parents reference emotions more frequently with daughters and mention sadness more with girls; fathers' gendered socialization is more strongly associated with children's gender differences than mothers'.

Peer influence operates through both selection and amplification. Gender segregation begins by age 2.5-3 and increases dramatically through elementary school. Martin et al.'s (2013) analysis using stochastic actor-based models found direct selection based on sex was the largest contributor to segregation, followed by activity-based selection. Within same-sex groups, peers enforce gender norms through teasing, exclusion, and criticism of nonconformity—LEGO's 2021 survey found 71% of boys feared being made fun of for playing with "girls' toys."

Teachers contribute through differential attention and expectations. Sadker and Sadker's research documented that teachers call on boys more often, ask boys harder questions, give boys extra time when they falter, and provide more praise and feedback to boys. A Chilean study of 237 videotaped classes found the gender attention gap correlated with lower math scores for girls. Experimental research by Hilliard and Liben (2010) showed that when preschool teachers made gender salient (separating activities by gender), children showed stronger stereotypes and less positive ratings of other-sex children.

Media and marketing serve as powerful socialization agents. Analysis by the Geena Davis Institute found toys marketed to girls are **18 times more likely** to demonstrate nurturing and domestic skills. Sweet (2013) documented that gender differentiation in toy advertising *increased* since the 1980s despite social progress in other domains. LoBue and DeLoache found girls begin selecting pink toys around age 2, with boys developing pink aversion along the same timeline—patterns that emerge through socialization rather than innate preference.

Gender schema theory explains how children become active agents in their own gender socialization. Once children acquire basic gender identity around age 2-3, they form cognitive schemas that guide attention, memory, and behavior. Children pay more attention to schema-consistent information and distort or forget inconsistent information—Martin and Halverson found children under 6 often switched the gender of a person to match an activity when recalling pictures. This self-socialization helps explain why preferences appear before substantial parental pressure could account for them.

## Childhood activities shape trajectories into adulthood through multiple pathways

Differential activities create divergent skill development. A Geosphere study found gender differences in mental rotation tasks (d = 0.42-0.63) are **fully mediated after adjusting for construction-based toy play**—75.6% of males but only 41.5% of females reported frequent construction play. Wong's 2025 Child Development study found boy-typical play positively predicted mental transformation ability while girl-typical play negatively predicted it, from preschool through middle childhood.

The Dunedin longitudinal study following participants for 50+ years found children's self-control at age 3 predicted adult health, financial security, and criminal behavior even controlling for childhood IQ and family social class. A 10-year UK study (ALSPAC) found preschool gender-typed play behavior at age 3.5 predicted adolescent gender-typed occupational interests—masculine play (blocks, vehicles) predicted interest in male-typical occupations regardless of the child's gender.

Physical health consequences are substantial. Less than 20% of the world's adolescent population is sufficiently active, with girls showing lower rates than boys across all studies. European data shows overweight and obesity prevalence at **21.1% for girls versus 18.6% for boys**. Physical activity in childhood protects against weight and fatness gains through adolescence into adulthood, with childhood sports participation showing better tracking into adulthood (r = 0.26) than general physical activity (r = 0.14).

Academic achievement links to extracurricular participation are well-established. Eccles and Barber's longitudinal study of 1,800 students found extracurricular participants achieved better educational outcomes controlling for social class, gender, and intellectual aptitude. However, the relationship is nonlinear—moderate participation in multiple domains yields highest GPA and sense of belonging, while excessive activities can become counterproductive. Finnish research found arts and music participation associated with greater adaptability and work skills, while sports participation predicted both academic success and, notably, higher rates of drinking.

## Evidence-based interventions can reduce gaps, but heavy-handed approaches backfire

Programs featuring female role models show meaningful effects on girls' STEM engagement. Breda et al.'s evaluation found girls in role-model interventions showed **20-30% increases in STEM interest** and a 50% increase in probability that top-performing girls would enroll in STEM programs—reducing the baseline gender gap by one-third. Meta-analysis of 12 STEM interventions found a pooled effect size of g = 0.43 for knowledge gains. Successful components include exposure to female STEM professionals, hands-on activities mimicking professional research, addressing stereotype threat, and creating "stereotype-safe environments."

Gender-neutral parenting remains largely unstudied despite popular interest. Morawska's systematic review of 45 studies confirmed parents respond differently to children by gender across vocalization, socialization, play, and toys, but overall evidence quality is poor and longitudinal studies are lacking. "Gender-open parenting" (not assigning gender at birth, using gender-neutral pronouns) has generated no robust outcome studies to date.

Single-sex education shows **trivial effects** when properly controlled. Pahlke, Hyde, and Allison's meta-analysis of 184 studies (1.6 million students across 21 nations) found that while uncontrolled studies show modest advantages for single-sex schooling in math, controlled studies with random assignment or selection controls reveal only trivial differences. Some controlled studies actually favored coeducation for girls' educational aspirations, and single-sex schools may reinforce rather than reduce gender stereotypes.

Nordic approaches represent the most systematic policy efforts. Sweden's national curriculum has required schools to oppose gender stereotypes since 1998. The Egalia preschool in Stockholm uses the gender-neutral pronoun "hen," de-segregates toys, employs 40% male staff, and has teachers video themselves to identify unconscious bias. Research on 80 Egalia children found they were more likely to play with opposite-sex peers and less likely to assign gender stereotypes—though sample sizes are small and long-term outcomes unknown.

Interventions can backfire through psychological reactance. A study of nearly 700 adults found stereotype-violating children are rated as **less likeable**, with stronger effects for boys than girls. Boys face more social punishment for cross-gender behavior, and heavy-handed interventions may trigger boomerang effects. Liben and Coyle warn that altering "masculine" toys to be more "feminine" may eliminate the spatial affordances that make them developmentally beneficial. Effective mitigation strategies include emphasizing free choice, perspective-taking, and forewarning rather than restriction.

## Conclusion: Both biological foundations and social construction shape gendered activities

The evidence supports an interactionist model where biological predispositions—likely prenatal hormone-mediated—create initial tendencies that socialization then shapes, amplifies, or modifies. Effect sizes for toy preferences (d > 1.5) are among the largest in psychology and emerge before substantial socialization could account for them. Yet parental provision of toys, peer enforcement of norms, teacher expectations, and media influence demonstrably affect outcomes.

The gender equality paradox suggests removing social barriers may allow underlying preferences to emerge more fully—but stereotype amplification in egalitarian societies provides an alternative explanation. What is clear is that neither "pure biology" nor "pure socialization" accounts for the data. The **160 million more hours daily** that girls spend on domestic work globally, the **12:1 male-to-female ratio** at elite math competitions, and the **64% of girls who quit sports** by late adolescence reflect a complex interplay of predispositions, opportunities, expectations, and choices.

Effective policy approaches focus on expanding options rather than restricting them: exposing all children to spatial play and physical activity, providing female role models in male-dominated fields and male role models in female-dominated ones, training teachers on unconscious bias, and intervening early before stereotypes consolidate. The evidence suggests we can reduce gendered gaps where they limit opportunity—while acknowledging that some preference differences may persist even in fully egalitarian environments.
