# Feminist Identity, Collective Narcissism, and Aggression: Empirical Research Synthesis

**Direct empirical research examining feminist identity and verbal/relational aggression is scarce, but adjacent literatures on collective narcissism, left-wing authoritarianism, and ideological identity offer substantial findings.** The most direct evidence comes from Krispenz and Bertrams's 2023 studies linking pathological narcissism to feminist activism through a "dark-ego-vehicle principle," and from Polish researchers demonstrating that threatened feminist identity produces exclusionary responses toward ideologically dissimilar women. Broader research reveals that collective narcissism—defensive, grandiose group identification—predicts intergroup hostility across political orientations, while evolutionary psychology establishes female indirect aggression as a distinct phenomenon unconnected to ideology in current empirical work.

## The dark-ego-vehicle principle links narcissism to activist involvement

The most direct peer-reviewed research addressing feminist identity and aggression comes from Krispenz and Bertrams's two 2023 studies published in *Current Psychology*. Their first study (N=391 and N=377 U.S. participants) examined left-wing authoritarianism and found that **anti-hierarchical aggression**—using force to overthrow those in power—was significantly associated with antagonistic narcissism and psychopathy, but showed no relationship with altruism or genuine social justice commitment. Neither prosocial motivation predicted aggressive left-wing attitudes; instead, dark personality traits did.

Their follow-up pre-registered study (N=458) specifically examined feminist activism. Higher **pathological narcissistic grandiosity** significantly predicted greater involvement in feminist collective action, even after controlling for altruism and feminist self-identification. The authors proposed the "dark-ego-vehicle principle" (DEVP): individuals with dark personality traits may use social movements—including feminism—to satisfy ego-focused needs such as status gain, moral superiority displays, and engagement in social conflict. Critically, the researchers emphasize this does not mean feminist activism is inherently narcissistic; altruism also predicted involvement. The finding indicates that movements attracting genuinely prosocial individuals may simultaneously attract those with darker motivations.

## Threatened feminist identity produces exclusionary in-group responses

Research from Polish psychologists Aleksandra Cichocka and colleagues provides evidence that threatened feminist identity affects responses to gender discrimination. In an experimental study with **96 Polish feminists** (female professionals and graduate students from Gender Studies at the University of Warsaw), participants were randomly assigned to identity threat versus control conditions, then evaluated discrimination scenarios where victims held either feminist or conservative views.

Under identity threat, feminists perceived situations as **less discriminatory** when victims held conservative rather than feminist views, and showed increased compassion for victims portrayed as feminists compared to conservatives. This conditional response—supporting in-group members while withholding support from ideologically dissimilar women experiencing the same discrimination—emerged only under threat conditions. The study demonstrates that threatened group identity can produce exclusionary, in-group favoring responses even among those ostensibly committed to opposing discrimination.

This finding aligns with broader collective narcissism research showing that defensive (versus secure) group identification predicts intergroup hostility. Collective narcissism—the belief that one's group is exceptional and deserves special recognition, combined with hypersensitivity to perceived insults—has been extensively validated across **five studies** by Golec de Zavala and colleagues (2009, *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*) as predicting retaliatory aggression, unwillingness to forgive outgroups, and preference for hostile actions, effects that persist beyond social dominance orientation and authoritarianism.

## Political identity centrality drives cancellation behavior regardless of partisan direction

Research on cancel culture and online mobbing reveals that **political identity centrality**—how important political identity is to one's self-concept—predicts cancelling proclivity including "calling-out" and "piling-on" behaviors, regardless of whether that identity is liberal or conservative. Mesler and colleagues (2024, *Acta Psychologica*, N=459) found this effect was mediated by social vigilantism (the tendency to correct "ignorant" others) and virtue signaling. The relationship applied equally to Democrats and Republicans—ideological extremity of identity, not partisan direction, drove aggressive sanctioning behaviors.

Supporting this, Ok and colleagues' six-study investigation (2020, *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, total N=3,536) found that **Dark Triad traits**—Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy—significantly predicted "virtuous victim signaling," with amoral manipulation as the strongest predictor. Those high in virtuous victim signaling were more likely to engage in ethically questionable behaviors such as lying for bonuses and exaggerating mistreatment. A UK replication (Bates et al., 2024, N=1,500) confirmed these associations and added that **sadism** specifically predicted attacking those accused of victimization.

Muir and colleagues (2023, *PLoS ONE*, N=411) identified predictors explaining **39% of variance** in online shaming intentions:
- Psychopathy (largest unique predictor)
- Social vigilantism
- Moral grandstanding
- Online disinhibition

Notably, empathy served as a protective factor, while emotional reactivity did not predict shaming intentions—contradicting narratives of moral outrage as impulsive "knee-jerk" responses.

## Evolutionary psychology documents female indirect aggression unconnected to ideology

Extensive evolutionary psychology research documents female intrasexual competition through indirect aggression—social exclusion, reputation damage, gossip—but this literature has not examined ideological correlates. Tracy Vaillancourt's studies (2011, 2013) demonstrated that women show strong intolerance of "sexy peers" who appear to make sex readily available, with almost all female participants rated as reacting negatively to provocatively dressed confederates. Benenson and colleagues (2011, 2013, *Psychological Science* and *PLOS ONE*) found that females are more willing than males to socially exclude temporary allies and, when faced with exclusion threats, exclude others more readily than males.

Key findings from this literature include:

- Women derogate rivals' appearance and sexual reputation more than men (Buss & Dedden, 1990)
- Women strategically transmit reputation-harming information about attractive, provocatively dressed women (Reynolds, Baumeister & Maner, 2018, five studies, N>1,000)
- Women rating high on intrasexual competitiveness show greater aggression toward sexualized women, mediated by reduced perceptions of humanness (Arnocky et al., 2019, *Psychological Science*)
- Social exclusion constitutes a more useful competitive strategy for females than males (Benenson et al., 2013)

However, **no peer-reviewed empirical studies** were identified that examine feminist ideology specifically through evolutionary or biosocial frameworks with measurable behavioral outcomes. The evolutionary literature focuses on competitive behaviors themselves rather than ideological correlates.

## Ideological intolerance shows symmetrical patterns across the political spectrum

Research on political intolerance challenges assumptions that exclusionary behavior concentrates on one side of the political spectrum. Brandt and colleagues' influential review (2014, *Current Directions in Psychological Science*) synthesized three independent laboratory programs demonstrating that **both liberals and conservatives express similar levels of intolerance** toward ideologically dissimilar and threatening groups. Crawford's experimental studies (2014, *Journal of Experimental Social Psychology*) found that safety threat predicted intolerance of left-wing activist groups while symbolic threat predicted intolerance of right-wing activist groups, with perceived threat fully mediating ideology's effect on intolerance in both directions.

Van Prooijen and Krouwel's review (2019) concluded that political extremism—left or right—reliably predicts intolerance more than political orientation alone. Both left-wing and right-wing extremists display stronger dogmatic intolerance compared to moderates and tend to consider opposing ideological beliefs inferior.

Research using the Cyberball ostracism paradigm (AuBuchon et al., 2025, *Journal of Applied Social Psychology*, N=451) demonstrated that political exclusion threatened psychological needs regardless of source, decreased outgroup affiliation willingness, and increased social media antisocial inclinations mediated by anger—effects consistent across political identities.

## Polish research reveals collective narcissism mechanisms in gender ideology conflicts

Poland has emerged as a significant research site for understanding collective narcissism and gender-related hostility. Marchlewska and colleagues (2019, *Journal of Social Psychology*) found that approximately **30% of Polish Catholics** endorsed "gender conspiracy beliefs"—viewing gender studies as secretly promoting harmful ideology. Catholic collective narcissism robustly predicted these beliefs and outgroup hostility toward LGBTQ individuals, with gender conspiracy beliefs mediating the relationship. Effects persisted beyond mere religiosity or belief in God.

Multiple studies by Golec de Zavala and colleagues demonstrated that:
- Male collective narcissism predicted sexism, mediated by precarious manhood beliefs
- Catholic collective narcissism predicted **tolerance of domestic violence** beyond religious fundamentalism
- National collective narcissism predicted hostile sexism in both men and women
- Non-narcissistic in-group satisfaction (secure identification) predicted *rejection* of violence against women

Cross-national research (Łyś et al., 2022, *Journal of Interpersonal Violence*, N=266) found Polish participants showed significantly higher levels of rape myth acceptance, gender essentialism, and ambivalent sexism than Norwegian and Hungarian participants, with hostile sexism mediating acceptance of violence against women.

## Gaps in empirical literature and methodological limitations

**Direct studies measuring verbal and relational aggression in feminist versus non-feminist women using validated instruments are absent from the peer-reviewed literature.** The Self-Report of Aggression and Social Behavior Measure (SRASBM) and similar tools have been applied to workplace settings, romantic relationships, and general populations, but no studies were identified applying these to activist or feminist organizational contexts.

Research on "purity spirals"—dynamics where communities fixate on implementing values with increasing extremity—remains largely theoretical and qualitative rather than quantitatively validated. Campbell and Manning's sociological work (2018) provides framework terminology but not empirical measurement.

Most collective narcissism studies use cross-sectional correlational designs, though several experimental studies (Golec de Zavala et al., 2013) demonstrate causal effects of threat on hostility relationships. Longitudinal research confirms temporal precedence of low personal control predicting later collective narcissism. Sample compositions vary, with substantial Polish, British, and U.S. representation but limited data from other European contexts.

## Conclusion: Identity threat and defensive identification drive exclusionary behaviors across movements

The empirical evidence indicates that exclusionary and aggressive behaviors in ideological contexts are driven less by specific political content than by **identity centrality, defensive group identification, and perceived threat**. The Krispenz and Bertrams studies provide the most direct evidence that pathological narcissism predicts feminist activism involvement independent of prosocial motivation, while Cichocka's research demonstrates that threatened feminist identity produces conditional, in-group favoring responses.

Collective narcissism research—predominantly from Polish collaborations between Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Marchlewska and others—establishes that defensive (versus secure) group identification predicts intergroup hostility, conspiracy beliefs about outgroups, and unwillingness to forgive perceived insults across national, religious, and political identity domains. The "dark-ego-vehicle principle" suggests that movements attracting genuine prosocial actors simultaneously attract those seeking ego gratification through moral superiority and conflict engagement.

Cancel culture research confirms that ideological extremity and identity centrality—not partisan direction—predict aggressive online sanctioning behaviors, with dark personality traits as consistent predictors. However, significant empirical gaps remain: no studies directly compare relational aggression rates between feminist and non-feminist women, and in-group policing dynamics within activist movements await systematic quantitative investigation using validated aggression measures.
