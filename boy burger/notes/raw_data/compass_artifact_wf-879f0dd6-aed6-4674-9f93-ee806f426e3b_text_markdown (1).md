# ZUS contributions by gender: Men pay more, but women receive more over their lifetime

Poland's pension system reveals a striking paradox: while men contribute substantially more to ZUS over their working lives—approximately **177,000-250,000 PLN** more than women—women ultimately receive **79% more in total lifetime pension benefits** due to earlier retirement and longer life expectancy. The net balance calculation shows both genders receive more than they contribute, but women achieve a significantly higher "return on investment" from the system.

## Total ZUS contributions reflect the gender wage gap

Poland's ZUS contribution system applies uniform percentage rates to wages, meaning the gender wage gap directly determines contribution differences. Based on May 2024 GUS data, men earn an average of **8,415.70 PLN** monthly compared to women's **7,575.48 PLN**—a gap of 840 PLN (10.0%). This wage differential translates directly into contribution differences across all ZUS categories.

The current contribution rates (2024-2025) break down as follows:

| Contribution Type | Total Rate | Employer | Employee |
|-------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Pension (emerytalne) | **19.52%** | 9.76% | 9.76% |
| Disability (rentowe) | 8.00% | 6.50% | 1.50% |
| Sickness (chorobowe) | 2.45% | 0% | 2.45% |
| Accident (wypadkowe) | 0.67-3.33% | 0.67-3.33% | 0% |

For pension contributions specifically, men contribute approximately **1,643 PLN monthly** compared to women's **1,479 PLN**—a difference of **164 PLN per month** or nearly **1,963 PLN annually**. Employer contributions follow the same pattern, meaning total employment-related contributions to ZUS are roughly **10% higher for male employees** across all categories.

## The lifetime contribution gap compounds dramatically

The five-year difference in retirement ages (men at 65, women at 60) combined with more frequent career interruptions creates a substantial lifetime contribution gap. Men typically contribute for **45 years** compared to women's **40 years**, and women's careers often include maternity-related breaks that further reduce their contribution totals.

Using 2024 wage data and nominal calculations (without inflation adjustment):

| Factor | Men | Women | Difference |
|--------|-----|-------|------------|
| Annual pension contributions | 19,713 PLN | 17,750 PLN | 1,963 PLN |
| Working years | 45 years | 40 years | 5 years |
| **Lifetime pension contributions** | **~887,000 PLN** | **~710,000 PLN** | **~177,000 PLN** |

When accounting for typical career patterns—including maternity leave and parental care periods—women's effective contribution years drop further. With **two children and associated reduced-contribution periods**, women's lifetime contributions fall to approximately **640,000-680,000 PLN**, widening the gap to **23-28%** compared to men.

During maternity and parental leave, ZUS contributions continue but are based on the maternity benefit amount (70-100% of salary basis) rather than full wages, creating a compound effect on lifetime totals. The state finances these contributions, but they accumulate at lower rates than regular employment would generate.

## Average pensions differ sharply, but the gap tells only part of the story

ZUS data from March 2025 shows men receive average monthly pensions of **4,978.67 PLN** compared to women's **3,421.61 PLN**—a gap of **31.3%** that has been widening over time. In December 2022, this gap was 1,160 PLN; by late 2024, it exceeded 1,500 PLN monthly.

The pension formula in Poland's NDC (Notional Defined Contribution) system directly explains this disparity. Monthly pension = (Accumulated contributions + initial capital) ÷ Expected remaining months of life. Women's lower accumulated contributions, divided over a longer expected lifespan (ZUS uses 264.2 months for women at 60 versus 218.9 months for men at 65), mechanically produces lower monthly payments.

However, life expectancy transforms the calculation entirely. Polish women at retirement age can expect to receive pensions for approximately **22 years**, compared to men's **18.24 years** according to GUS tables used by ZUS. Actual life expectancy data suggests an even larger gap: women live to 82.26 years on average versus men's 74.93 years—meaning women retiring at 60 may collect pensions for 22+ years while men retiring at 65 receive them for roughly 10 years.

## The net balance reveals women as system beneficiaries

Calculating total lifetime benefits transforms the picture dramatically:

| Metric | Men | Women |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Monthly pension | 4,978.67 PLN | 3,421.61 PLN |
| Years receiving pension | ~18.24 | ~22.02 |
| **Lifetime pension benefits** | **~1,089,000 PLN** | **~903,000 PLN** |
| Lifetime contributions | ~887,000 PLN | ~640-710,000 PLN |
| **Net balance** | **+202,000 PLN** | **+193-263,000 PLN** |

Both genders receive more than they contribute—consistent with the IMF's finding that European pension systems currently pay out approximately **1.7 times** what contributors pay in. However, the critical insight lies in the "return on investment" ratio.

The most comprehensive academic analysis comes from Hammer et al.'s 2020 National Transfer Accounts study covering 15 European countries. For Poland specifically, this research found women receive **8.4 years of average labor income (YL)** in total public old-age benefits, compared to men's **4.7 YL**—meaning **women receive 79% more in lifetime pension benefits** despite lower yearly amounts. Women receive public pension benefits for an average of **25.3 years** compared to men's **14.7 years**.

## European comparison shows Poland's unique position

Poland occupies an unusual position in European pension systems. The country maintains one of the **largest retirement age gaps** (5 years) among OECD nations—only Colombia, Costa Rica, Hungary, Israel, and Türkiye still have gender-differentiated ages. This structural feature, combined with Poland's NDC contribution-linked system, creates distinctive gender dynamics.

Poland's **gender pension gap of approximately 15-20%** is actually among the lowest in the EU, well below the EU-27 average of 29% and dramatically below Luxembourg (44%), Germany (36%), and the Netherlands (40%). This relatively low gap reflects Poland's historical legacy of high female labor force participation during the socialist period, which produced more equal contribution records.

The OECD projects particularly concerning outcomes for Poland's future retirees. For average-wage workers retiring in 2065, replacement rates are projected at **40.3% for men** and **31.5% for women**—the largest gender gap in the OECD at 22%. Poland's replacement rates rank among the lowest in developed economies, alongside Australia, Estonia, Japan, and Korea.

The motherhood penalty compounds these effects. Polish research by Jędrzychowska et al. found that the motherhood pension gap in Poland's defined contribution system ranges from **4.5-9.5% for one child** to **12.5-25% for four children**, reflecting both direct contribution losses and indirect wage effects of career interruptions.

## Key structural factors drive the gender balance

Poland's pension gender dynamics result from intersecting policy choices and demographic realities. The **5-year retirement age difference** (60 vs 65) remains the single largest factor, reducing women's contribution periods by 11% while extending their benefit receipt periods by 20-50%. Poland's 2017 return to differentiated retirement ages (from unified 67) significantly shifted the gender balance back toward favoring women as net beneficiaries.

The use of **unisex life expectancy tables** for pension calculations creates a mechanical redistribution. ZUS uses combined male-female mortality data, meaning women's longer actual life expectancy is averaged with men's shorter expectancy. This increases calculated pensions for women (who will receive benefits longer than the tables assume) while decreasing men's (who will likely receive benefits for shorter periods).

Minimum pension requirements also favor women: qualifying for the guaranteed minimum pension requires **20 years of contributions for women** versus **25 years for men**. Combined with lower earning thresholds throughout their careers, women face systematically lower barriers to pension eligibility.

## Conclusion

The evidence demonstrates that while men contribute substantially more to Poland's ZUS system over their working lives—approximately 20-28% more in total pension contributions—the net lifetime balance favors women considerably. European research indicates women receive approximately **79% more in total lifetime pension benefits** relative to men when measured in years of average labor income.

This outcome reflects Poland's particular combination of a 5-year retirement age gap, women's 7+ year life expectancy advantage, and the NDC system's mechanical division of accumulated capital over expected remaining lifespan. Both genders currently receive more than they contribute (consistent with EU-wide findings of a 1.7x payout ratio), but women achieve significantly higher returns on their contributions.

The key calculation the user sought—net balance of contributions minus benefits—shows men contribute ~887,000 PLN and receive ~1,089,000 PLN (+202,000 net), while women contribute ~640-710,000 PLN and receive ~903,000 PLN (+193-263,000 net). In relative terms, women's lifetime benefits represent approximately **127-141%** of their lifetime contributions, compared to men's approximately **123%**—making women the net beneficiaries of redistributive flows within Poland's pension system.
