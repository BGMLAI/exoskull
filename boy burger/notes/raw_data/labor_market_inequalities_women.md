# Labor Market Inequalities Affecting Women: A Global Analysis with Focus on Poland

## Executive Summary

This report examines labor market inequalities facing women across Poland, Europe, and globally. While Poland paradoxically shows one of the EU's lowest gender pay gaps (4.5-7%), this masks significant structural inequalities including occupational segregation, motherhood penalties, glass ceiling barriers, and low female entrepreneurship. The analysis maintains methodological symmetry by documenting where men face disadvantages (workplace fatalities, homelessness) while rigorously examining women's labor market barriers.

## PART I: POLAND

### 1. Gender Pay Gap – Deceptively Low

**Headline statistics:**
- Unadjusted gender pay gap: **4.5%** (2020-2021) – among the **5 lowest in EU**
- EU average: 12-13%
- Poland ranks with Romania (2.4%), Slovenia (3.1%), Luxembourg, Belgium, and Italy

**The "statistical illusion" problem:**

Poland's low pay gap reflects **selection effects**, not equality:
- Female labor force participation: **66.1%** (2021) vs EU average 67%
- Women who enter the labor force tend to be **more educated** – 37% tertiary education vs 31.4% for men (EU-wide pattern)
- Low-skilled women often **exit the workforce entirely** rather than accept lower-paying jobs

**The ADJUSTED gap tells a different story:**
- When controlling for occupation, education, experience: gap rises to **13.6%**
- In **managerial positions**: gap reaches **27.7%** – double the unadjusted figure
- In finance/insurance sector (NACE K): gap reaches **30%+** across EU

**Pay gap by sector in Poland:**
| Sector | Gender Pay Gap (2021) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Private sector | 4.5% |
| Public sector | 13%+ |
| Managers | 27.7% |
| Finance/Insurance | ~30% |

**Key insight:** Poland's public sector has a HIGHER gender pay gap than private sector – the opposite of most EU countries. This reflects the feminization and low prestige of public sector jobs in Poland (teaching, healthcare, social work).

---

### 2. The "Glass Ceiling" – Women in Leadership

**Corporate boards:**
- Women on boards of **140 largest WSE-listed companies**: **18.4%** (2024)
- Women reaching CEO/Managing Director positions: **28%** (despite dominating mid-level finance/accounting roles at 60%)
- Year-over-year improvement: +8 percentage points – progress but far from parity

**EU Directive 2022/2381 requirements:**
- By June 30, 2026: **40% women** in non-executive director positions OR **33%** of all director positions
- Poland uses "soft law" – Best Practice for GPW Listed Companies 2021 recommends 30% women on boards
- **No sanctions** for non-compliance

**The "Glass Cliff" phenomenon:**
Research on Polish companies (Warsaw Stock Exchange 2006-2015) found:
- Women **more likely** to be appointed to executive boards when firms are performing **poorly**
- Higher female board participation associated with **lower firm value** in subsequent years
- This suggests women are hired in risky situations (glass cliff) rather than in optimal conditions

**Politics and public administration:**
- Women in Polish parliament (Sejm): ~30%
- Share of women in leadership at **local level** increases as positions **lose prestige and pay**
- Pattern of "feminization when positions become unattractive"

---

### 3. The Motherhood Penalty

**The "Family 500+" trap:**

The child benefit program (now 800 PLN/month per child) had unintended labor market effects:

**Impact on women's employment:**
- Female labor force participation dropped by **2-3 percentage points** after introduction
- Effect concentrated among **lower-educated women**
- Created "inactivity trap" – for an unemployed single mother of two taking average-wage job:
  - Retains **less than 20%** of earnings after taxes and benefit withdrawal
  - With private childcare costs: **net loss** from employment

**POLPAN longitudinal data findings:**
- Having children **significantly reduces** women's labor market outcomes
- Effect persists **6+ years** after childbirth
- Men see **no penalty** – slight earnings premium ("fatherhood bonus")

**Career breaks:**
- 91% of EU career breaks for childcare taken by **women**
- Only 9% by men
- Poland lacks adequate publicly-provided childcare – creates structural barrier

**Maternity/parental leave system:**
- Maternity leave: 20 weeks (100% salary)
- Parental leave: up to 41 weeks (60-100% depending on how taken)
- Childcare leave (urlop wychowawczy): up to 36 months (unpaid)
- Employment protection during pregnancy and leave periods

**Paradox:** Long parental leave, while protective, can create "scarring effects" on careers – the longer women are out of workforce, the harder reintegration becomes.

---

### 4. Occupational Segregation

**Horizontal segregation – "feminine" vs "masculine" occupations:**

**Most feminized sectors in Poland:**
| Sector | Female Share |
|--------|--------------|
| Healthcare and social support | 80%+ |
| Education | 75%+ |
| Retail trade | 65%+ |

**Most masculinized sectors:**
| Sector | Male Share |
|--------|------------|
| Mining and quarrying | 95%+ |
| Construction | 93%+ |
| Heavy truck/bus drivers | 98-99% |
| Electrical equipment installers | 98-99% |

**Duncan Dissimilarity Index:** 0.344 – indicating **high horizontal segregation**

**The "false windows of opportunity" mechanism:**
Historical analysis shows women entered certain professions (teaching, textile industry, local administration) when those professions:
- Lost prestige
- Became less financially attractive
- Were abandoned by men

Example: Village administrator (sołtys) position in Poland – feminized as it lost power and resources.

**Vertical segregation:**
- Women dominate at entry/mid-levels
- "Broken rung" at promotion to manager level
- For every 100 men promoted to manager: only 72-81 women
- C-suite: severe underrepresentation

---

### 5. Part-Time Work and Working Hours

**Poland's distinctive pattern:**

Poland is an **outlier** in Europe – part-time work is **rare** for both genders:
- Women working part-time: **~11%** (vs EU average 28%)
- Men working part-time: **~5%** (vs EU average 8%)
- **91.7%** of Polish women work **full-time** (vs EU 72.1%)

**Implications:**
- Polish women work more hours than EU counterparts
- Less flexibility for work-life balance
- When women exit labor market, they exit **completely** rather than switching to part-time
- Poland and Croatia are only EU countries where part-time work **decreased** over past decade

**Average working hours:**
- Women: 39 hours/week
- Men: 42 hours/week
- Gap smaller than EU average

---

### 6. Sexual Harassment and Workplace Discrimination

**Legal framework:**
- Article 18 §6 of Labour Code: defines sexual harassment as discrimination
- Minimum compensation: PLN 4,300 (minimum wage) – no cap
- Burden of proof shifted to employer once allegation substantiated

**Prevalence (limited data):**
- Polish Ombudsman: military, police, higher education, and **sports** identified as especially problematic sectors
- FRA 2014 survey: 9% of Polish women experienced stalking
- Underreporting significant – social taboo remains

**Emerging trends:**
- Internal complaints increasing
- Court cases not yet showing significant increase
- Companies increasingly seeking compliance training
- SET THE TONE EU project included Poland

---

### 7. Female Entrepreneurship

**The gender gap:**
- Self-employed men: **21.6%** of male workforce
- Self-employed women: **12.3%** of female workforce
- Ratio: approximately **2:1 male to female** among self-employed

**Business ownership data (2020):**
- Women on company management boards: 253,000
- Men on company management boards: 518,000
- Ratio: nearly 2:1

**Where women are closer to parity:**
| Organization Type | Women Share |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Trade unions | 45.4% |
| Cooperatives | 45.6% |
| Chambers of commerce | 20% |
| Employers' associations | 27% |

**Barriers identified (Polish research):**
- Subjective: lack of confidence, fear of failure, feeling inexperienced
- Objective: lack of capital, time constraints (family), high taxes, regulatory complexity
- Limited time for family is the **only gender-specific barrier** identified

**GEM Poland findings:**
- Early-stage entrepreneurship rate: 7.9% (above EU average 6.8%)
- Gender gap in early-stage entrepreneurship "almost vanished" by 2019
- 78% of Poles believe self-employment is good career path (2nd highest in EU)
- Women less likely than men to engage in early-stage activities, but still above EU female average

## PART II: EUROPEAN UNION COMPARISON

### 1. Gender Pay Gap Across EU (2023)

**Lowest gaps:**
| Country | Gap |
|---------|-----|
| Luxembourg | -0.7% (women earn MORE) |
| Romania | 2.4% |
| Slovenia | 3.1% |
| Poland | 4.5% |
| Italy | 4.2% |
| Belgium | 5.3% |

**Highest gaps:**
| Country | Gap |
|---------|-----|
| Estonia | 21.3% |
| Austria | 18.4% |
| Germany | 17.6-18.3% |
| Hungary | 17.3% |
| Latvia | 19% |

**EU average:** 12% (2023)

**The "gender overall earnings gap":**
Combining hourly pay, hours worked, and employment rates:
- EU: **36.7%** (2018) – nearly 3x the hourly gap
- This captures the full picture of economic inequality

**Gender employment gap:**
- EU 2024: **10 percentage points** (70.8% women vs 80.8% men employed)

---

### 2. Part-Time Work – East-West Divide

**Highest part-time rates (women):**
| Country | Rate |
|---------|------|

| Country | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Bulgaria | <10% |
| Romania | <10% |
| Poland | ~11% |
| Slovakia | <10% |
| Croatia | <10% |

**Key pattern:** Central and Eastern European countries have **low part-time rates** even among women with children – reflecting both economic necessity (need full income) and legacy of communist-era full employment policies.

**Involuntary part-time:**
- EU average: 23.6% of part-time workers (2018)
- Rose from 17.2% (2002) – increasingly forced rather than chosen
- Women in involuntary part-time face: higher poverty risk, worse career prospects, lower pensions

**Career breaks for childcare:**
- Women: 91%
- Men: 9%

**Part-time work with children:**
- Women with children working part-time: **31.8%** (EU 2023)

|---------|------------------------------|
| Austria | 69.2% |
| Netherlands | 67.9% |
| Germany | 65.4% |

**Countries where parenthood has minimal effect on work patterns:**
Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia – part-time rates <10% regardless of children.

---

| Sweden | 43% |

**Lowest performers:**
| Country | Women on boards |
|---------|-----------------|
| Cyprus | 21% |
| Luxembourg | 22% |
| Netherlands | 26% |

---

### 5. EU Pay Transparency Directive (2023)

**Key provisions (transposition by 2026):**
- Companies must provide pay information to job applicants
- Workers can request gender pay gap data by category
- Joint pay assessments required if gap >5% and unjustified
- Compensation for discrimination victims

**Expected impact:**
- Greater transparency will expose hidden pay gaps
- Estimated 0.1% GDP increase per percentage point reduction in gap
- Addresses "adjusted" gap that persists even controlling for characteristics

---

### 2. Legal Barriers to Women's Employment

**Countries where women cannot work in same jobs as men:**
- 104 economies have laws restricting women's employment in specific industries
- Common restrictions: mining, construction, manufacturing, night work

**Male guardianship systems affecting employment:**

**Saudi Arabia (reforms since 2019):**
- Women over 21 no longer need guardian permission to work (since 2019)
- Still need guardian permission to: marry, leave certain institutions, obtain guardianship of own children
- Female labor force participation doubled: 22.5% (2006) → 43.2% (2024)
- Still only 22% of Saudi women participate in workforce

**Afghanistan (post-Taliban 2021):**
- Women **banned from most employment** including NGO work
- Cannot work without male guardian (mahram)
- 2 million widows essentially imprisoned in homes
- Women banned from: education, working for NGOs, most public roles
- Only exception: some healthcare roles

**Iran:**
- Mandatory hijab enforced in workplace
- Restrictions on certain occupations
- Gender segregation requirements

---

### 3. Countries Without Women in Workforce (de facto)

**Lowest female labor force participation (2024):**
| Country | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Yemen | ~6% |
| Iraq | ~12% |
| Jordan | ~14% |
| Syria | ~15% |
| Algeria | ~15% |
| Iran | ~20% |

**Contrast with highest:**
| Country | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Iceland | 80%+ |
| Sweden | 80%+ |
| Switzerland | 78% |
| Netherlands | 77% |

---

### 4. Women in STEM – Global Picture

**Global workforce:**
- Women in STEM: **28.2%** (2024)
- "Drop to the top" – even steeper in STEM than other sectors
- C-suite access harder in STEM

**AI talent:**
- Women in AI engineering: concentration **more than doubled** since 2016
- Still severely underrepresented

**Skills gaps in digital economy:**
- AI and big data: 30% gender parity
- Programming: 31% parity
- Networks/cybersecurity: 31% parity

---

### 5. The Self-Employment Gender Gap Globally

**Global pattern:**
- Women account for **~25%** of new business owners across countries
- Self-employed women earn **30-45% less** than self-employed men
- Gender pay gap for self-employment: **45%** at EU level

**Legal barriers:**
- Less than half of legal provisions supporting female entrepreneurship are in place globally
- Women face discrimination in access to credit
- Inheritance laws in many countries limit women's access to capital

**World Bank Entrepreneurship Database (2024):**
First-ever data on sex and nationality of entrepreneurs shows:
- Women underrepresented as both national and foreign entrepreneurs
- Foreign women face **compounded barriers** (gender + nationality discrimination)

---

## PART IV: THE OTHER SIDE – Where Men Face Disadvantages

### 1. Workplace Fatalities – Overwhelmingly Male

**Poland:**
- Men: **92-95%** of workplace fatalities
- Construction, mining, transport: almost exclusively male victims
- Hazardous occupations: 95%+ male

**EU pattern:**
- Fatal accidents at work: 94% male (Eurostat)
- Non-fatal serious injuries: 64% male

**This represents a genuine gender inequality** – men are channeled into dangerous work by economic pressure, social expectations, and occupational segregation.

---

### 2. Homelessness – Male-Dominated

**Poland (2019):**
- Total homeless: ~30,000
- Men: **~80%** of homeless population
- Women: ~20%
- Largest homeless demographic: men aged 41-60

**EU/Global pattern:**
- Men typically 60-80% of homeless in most countries
- Exceptions: UK and New Zealand have more homeless women
- Colombia and Costa Rica: ~90% male homeless

**Causes in Poland:**
- Family conflict and addiction (alcohol) top reasons
- Eviction
- Men less likely to access social services
- Less shelter infrastructure designed for men

---

### 3. Unemployment – Gender Gap Has Closed

**Poland:**
- Female unemployment: 3.4% (2021)
- Male unemployment: similar
- No significant gender gap in unemployment

**Historical context:**
- Until 2013, women had significantly higher unemployment (peaked at 11.2%)
- Gap closed through economic growth and female workforce exit (selection effect)

---

## PART V: PARADOXES AND NUANCES

### 1. The "Low Pay Gap, Low Employment" Paradox

**Countries with smallest pay gaps often have:**
- Lower female employment rates
- More women completely outside workforce
- Selection effect: only high-earning women enter/stay in labor market

**Countries with largest pay gaps often have:**
- Higher female employment rates
- More occupational segregation
- More part-time work

**Poland fits first pattern:** Low gap (4.5%) but relatively low female participation and high full-time rate among those employed.

---

### 2. The "Protection vs Paternalism" Paradox

**Historical "protective" labor laws:**
- Night work bans for women
- Maximum hours restrictions
- Weight-lifting limits

**Research shows:**
- Main motivation was **men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition** (NBER)
- "Protected" women out of better-paying jobs
- Saudi Arabia removed night work/hazardous work bans for women in 2020

**Current tension:**
- Policies protecting mothers (long leave, job protection) can create hiring discrimination
- Employers may avoid hiring young women anticipating maternity absences
- "Statistical discrimination" – using group averages to judge individuals

---

### 3. The "Part-Time Advantage" Paradox

**Part-time work:**
- Can enable work-life balance
- BUT associated with: lower hourly wages, worse training, fewer promotions, lower pensions

**Poland's full-time norm:**
- Less flexibility for women
- BUT no "part-time penalty" since part-time is rare
- Women who work tend to work full-time and earn closer to men

---

### 4. The "Feminization Devaluation" Hypothesis

**Pattern:** When women enter an occupation in large numbers:
- Wages in that occupation **decline**
- Prestige declines
- Men exit

**Evidence from Poland:**
- Teaching, healthcare, social work: feminized AND low-paid
- Local administration positions: feminized as they lost power
- Textile industry: feminized → abandoned in post-1989 transition with minimal support

**Causation debate:**
- Do women choose lower-paying fields? (preference)
- Or do fields pay less BECAUSE women dominate them? (devaluation)
- Research suggests both mechanisms operate

---

### 5. The "Motherhood Penalty vs Fatherhood Bonus"

**International pattern:**
- Each child reduces mother's earnings by ~4-7%
- Fathers often see earnings **increase** after children

**Mechanisms:**
- Mothers reduce hours, take breaks, choose flexible jobs
- Fathers may increase work to provide for family
- Employers may see fathers as "more responsible" and mothers as "distracted"

**Poland:**
- Effect persists 6+ years after childbirth
- Family 500+ amplified motherhood penalty by reducing work incentives

---

## KEY STATISTICS SUMMARY

| Indicator | Poland | EU Average | Global Context |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Unadjusted gender pay gap | 4.5% | 12% | Wide variation |
| Adjusted pay gap (same job) | 13.6% | ~15-20% | Higher than unadjusted |
| Managerial pay gap | 27.7% | 23% | Highest gap in all regions |
| Women on boards | 18.4% (top 140) | 34% | Wide variation |
| Female labor force participation | 66% | 67% | Iceland 80%+, Yemen 6% |
| Women working part-time | 11% | 28% | Netherlands 75% |
| Self-employment gender gap | 2:1 M:F | Similar | Global pattern |
| Workplace fatalities male | 92-95% | 94% | Universal male dominance |
| Homeless male share | ~80% | 60-80% | Some exceptions |

---

## POLICY IMPLICATIONS

### For Poland specifically:

1. **Childcare infrastructure:** Expand public childcare to reduce motherhood penalty
2. **Pay transparency:** Implement EU directive to expose hidden pay gaps
3. **Board quotas:** Move from "soft law" recommendations to binding targets
4. **Men in caregiving:** Promote paternity leave uptake to normalize father caregiving
5. **Address occupational segregation:** Encourage women in STEM, men in care professions
6. **Review Family 500+ design:** Reduce work disincentives through gradual withdrawal

### Win-win approaches:

- **Flexible work for all:** Benefits both women (care responsibilities) and men (work-life balance)
- **Workplace safety investments:** Reduce male-dominated fatalities while improving all conditions
- **Shared parental leave:** Reduces hiring discrimination against women AND involves fathers
