# Strengthening the Loop of Insufficiency Model for Academic Publication

**Bottom line:** The empirical evidence does **not** support a clean dichotomy where mothers transmit gender norms implicitly while fathers use explicit mechanisms. Natural experiments establishing causality between gender socialization and male outcomes are surprisingly scarce. Bidirectional IPV research is robust but contested on methodological grounds. Successfully publishing this model requires addressing substantial academic criticisms, reframing several claims, and acknowledging significant evidence gaps.

## Part 1: Implicit versus explicit transmission lacks clear parent-gender distinction

The hypothesis that mothers predominantly use unconscious mechanisms while fathers use conscious enforcement **is not well-supported** by current evidence. Research reveals a more complex picture where both parents employ both mechanisms.

### Evidence table for implicit/explicit transmission

| Study | Parent | Mechanism | Key Finding | Effect Size | Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Thomassin et al. (2019)** Can J Behav Sci | Both | Implicit (IAT) | Mothers showed implicit bias favoring daughters' emotional expression; **fathers showed NO implicit bias** | Not reported | N≈600; children 8-12; replicated |
| **Mascaro et al. (2017)** Behav Neurosci | Fathers | Both | Fathers used achievement language with sons, emotion language with daughters; biases "may be unconscious" | Not quantified | N=52; fMRI + naturalistic observation |
| **Endendijk et al. (2016)** PLOS ONE Meta | Both | Behavioral | **Mothers and fathers did NOT differ** in gender-differentiated parental control | d=0.08 (control); d=0.03 (autonomy) | k=126 studies; N=15,034 families |
| **Chhin, Bleeker & Jacobs (2008)** APA | Both | Explicit attitudes | Mother's traditional attitudes predicted sons' occupational choices; **no effect for fathers** | Not reported | Longitudinal ages 12-20 |
| **Endendijk et al. (2013)** | Both | Explicit stereotypes | Fathers showed **more explicit** gender stereotypes than mothers | Not reported | Netherlands sample |
| **Lytton & Romney (1991)** Psych Bull | Both | Behavioral | Fathers differentiate more between sons/daughters in gender-typed activities | Small effects | Meta-analysis |
| **Tenenbaum & Leaper (2002)** | Both | Multiple | Positive association (r=.16) between parents' and children's gender attitudes | r=.16 | Meta-analysis of 43 studies |

### Critical interpretation

The strongest evidence (Thomassin et al., 2019) found mothers showed implicit bias while fathers showed **no** implicit bias—but this doesn't demonstrate fathers use more explicit mechanisms; they may simply be less involved in emotional socialization. Mascaro et al. (2017) explicitly noted fathers' differential treatment "may be unconscious," undermining the explicit-mechanism hypothesis.

**Model implication:** Reframe from "mothers implicit/fathers explicit" to "**both parents transmit through both mechanisms, with fathers potentially more rigid in explicit behavioral enforcement and mothers showing stronger implicit emotional bias**."

## Part 2: Natural experiments establishing causality are remarkably scarce

A critical finding: **no natural experiments directly test causal links between custody arrangements or gender socialization policies and male suicide/mortality outcomes.** This represents a major evidence gap.

### Available natural experiments

| Study | Design | Intervention | Male Outcome | Strength |
|-------|--------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Stevenson & Wolfers (2006)** QJE | Difference-in-difference | Unilateral divorce laws (37 U.S. states, 1969-1985) | **No significant effect on male suicide** (-4.9% non-significant); female suicide declined 20% | Strong |
| **Kposowa (2000, 2003)** JECH | Longitudinal cohort | N/A (observational) | Divorced men RR=2.38 for suicide vs. married; 8-9x higher than divorced women | Moderate (selection bias concerns) |
| **Cools, Fiva & Kirkebøen (2015)** JEEA | Regression discontinuity | Norwegian "Daddy Quota" paternity leave (1993) | No effect on fathers' earnings/work hours; increased childcare involvement | Strong |
| **Dahl, Kotsadam & Rooth (2021)** QJE | RCT | Random female integration into male military squads | Men developed more egalitarian attitudes; **effects did not persist** after 6 months | Very Strong |
| **Deole & Zeydanli (2021)** Econ Ed Rev | Instrumental variable | Compulsory schooling reforms across 26 European countries | Additional education increased egalitarian attitudes by 0.05-0.3 SD | Strong |

### The crucial gap

The correlational finding that divorced men face 2.38x higher suicide risk (Kposowa) has **never been tested causally** using policy variation as an instrument. The Swedish 1998 joint custody reform—which increased joint custody from 1% to 30-40%—has not been rigorously analyzed for effects on male mental health outcomes using administrative data.

**Model implication:** Acknowledge this as a **major limitation**. State: "While correlational evidence suggests custody arrangements affect male wellbeing, causal studies using exogenous policy variation are absent. The model's causal claims require natural experiment validation that does not yet exist."

## Part 3: Bidirectional IPV statistics are robust but contextually nuanced

The evidence on bidirectional violence is extensive, though highly contested on methodological grounds.

### Core statistics with sources

| Finding | Percentage | Source | Sample Size |
|---------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Bidirectional violence** (of violent relationships) | **49.7-57.9%** | Whitaker et al. (2007) CDC/AJPH; PASK (2012) | 11,370 (Whitaker); ~12,000 studies reviewed (PASK) |
| Female-only perpetration (of unidirectional) | **28.3%** | Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al. (2012) PASK | 82,836 weighted |
| Male-only perpetration (of unidirectional) | **13.8%** | Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al. (2012) PASK | 82,836 weighted |
| F-to-M unidirectional ratio | **2.05:1** | PASK systematic review | Population samples |
| Women as injury victims | **62%** | Archer (2000) Psych Bull meta-analysis | 64,000+ participants |
| Injury risk in reciprocal violence | **4.4x higher** than non-reciprocal | Whitaker et al. (2007) | CDC data |

### Initiation findings

Research on who initiates physical violence shows **mixed but generally symmetric findings**:
- **Capaldi et al. (2007)** observational study: Women more likely to be observed initiating in at-risk couples
- **Johnson (2006)**: Situational couple violence "seems to be equally initiated by men and women"
- Self-defense endorsed by minority: 0-21% of men; 5-35% of women in non-perpetrator samples

### Johnson's typology critical context

Michael Johnson's framework distinguishes:
1. **Situational Couple Violence (SCV)**: Gender-symmetric, arising from conflict escalation—dominant in population surveys
2. **Intimate Terrorism (IT)**: Violence + coercive control, claimed "almost entirely male" in heterosexual relationships—dominant in shelter samples
3. **Violent Resistance**: Violence responding to IT, claimed predominantly female

**However, Johnson's typology is contested.** Straus (2011) reviewed 91 empirical comparisons finding "symmetry and mutual violence perpetration is typical of relationships involving severe and injurious assaults." McDonald et al. (2009) found 67% of shelter women (IT sample) engaged in severe violence toward partners.

### The 58% statistic

The "58% mutual violence" figure likely derives from PASK's **57.9%** weighted average for bidirectional violence across large population samples.

**Model implication:** Present IPV findings with full context: "Approximately 50-58% of violent relationships are bidirectional. In unidirectional cases, female-to-male perpetration is approximately twice as common as male-to-female. **However, women sustain 62% of injuries and experience more severe consequences, indicating perpetration rates alone do not capture harm distribution.**"

## Part 4: Academic criticisms requiring preemptive address

For peer review acceptance, the model must anticipate and address these major objections:

### Methodological criticisms

| Criticism | Who Makes It | Must Address |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **CTS lacks context/motive data** | Dobash & Dobash; DeKeseredy; National Institute of Justice | Report injury outcomes separately; include contextual measures; distinguish perpetration from harm |
| **Selection bias in MRA-aligned research** | Kimmel; Flood; Mann | Use probability sampling; triangulate data sources; acknowledge sample limitations |
| **Low interobserver reliability** | Multiple methodologists | Couples report near-zero agreement on events; use multiple informants when possible |

### Theoretical criticisms

| Criticism | Who Makes It | Must Address |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Biological essentialism** | Fine (*Delusions of Gender*); Connell; Fausto-Sterling | Frame biology as "influence" not "determinant"; emphasize plasticity; cite biosocial models (Eagly & Wood) |
| **Evolutionary psychology "just-so stories"** | Buller; Longino; textbook critiques | Specify mechanisms; acknowledge EP provides framework not universal predictions; cite cross-cultural replications |
| **Strawman of feminism** | Metapsychology reviews; academic critics of Farrell/Baumeister | Engage with actual feminist scholarship (Connell, Kimmel, Messner); acknowledge feminist insights on masculinity costs |

### Political/ideological criticisms

| Criticism | Who Makes It | Must Address |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Association with misogynist movements** | SPLC; Flood; Carian | Explicitly distance from MRA rhetoric; acknowledge women's issues; focus on solutions not competitive victimhood |
| **"Oppression Olympics"** | Kimmel; feminist scholars | Frame as complementary to (not competing with) women's issues; use intersectional analysis; acknowledge continuing female disadvantages |
| **Gender empathy gap is socialized, not biological** | Martingano (2025); Pang et al. (2023 EEG) | EEG studies show no sex difference in neural empathy responses; gap disappears when social expectations removed |

### Specific researcher criticisms to anticipate

- **Warren Farrell**: Documented factual errors by Sterba; dismissed as "shock-horror hyperbole" by academic reviewers; political science PhD not psychology
- **Roy Baumeister**: Self-described as "essay, not scholarly work"; criticized for cherry-picking; engages "strawman" feminism by his own admission
- **Murray Straus**: CTS methodology fundamentally contested; findings used to cut shelter funding (raising political sensitivity)

## Part 5: Specific recommendations for model improvement

### Structural changes

1. **Add bidirectionality**: Replace unidirectional causal arrows with feedback loops where evidence supports reciprocal causation
2. **Include moderators**: Race, class, sexuality moderate all pathways—add intersectional analysis
3. **Distinguish mechanism types**: Separate "transmission" into implicit (modeling, differential attention) and explicit (verbal instruction, rule enforcement) pathways for both parents
4. **Add consequence asymmetry**: For IPV, show perpetration rates vs. harm/injury outcomes as separate constructs

### Methodological strengthening

1. **Use validated instruments**: G-NORM Scale (distinguishes descriptive/injunctive norms), BSRI-12 (gender roles), AWS-15 (gender attitudes)
2. **Triangulate data sources**: Combine survey data with behavioral observation, physiological measures (IAT, EEG), and administrative records
3. **Report effect sizes**: Cohen's d, confidence intervals, and practical significance alongside statistical significance
4. **Preregister hypotheses**: Use OSF or AsPredicted before data collection

### Theoretical strengthening

1. **Adopt biosocial framing**: Replace biological determinism with gene-environment interaction model (Eagly & Wood)
2. **Engage feminist scholarship**: Cite Connell on how patriarchy harms men; acknowledge feminist masculinities research
3. **Avoid naturalistic fallacy**: Explicitly state that "is" does not imply "ought"—descriptive findings do not justify normative conclusions

## Part 6: Suggested rewording for controversial claims

| Original Framing | Suggested Rewording | Rationale |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| "Mothers transmit gender norms through unconscious mechanisms" | "**Mothers show implicit bias in emotional socialization** (Thomassin et al., 2019), though both parents employ both implicit and explicit mechanisms" | Evidence doesn't support clean dichotomy |
| "Fathers enforce gender norms explicitly" | "**Fathers exhibit more explicit gender stereotypes** (Endendijk et al., 2013) **and differentiate more in gender-typed activity encouragement** (Lytton & Romney, 1991)" | More precise, evidence-based |
| "Women initiate domestic violence more often" | "In population surveys, **female-to-male unidirectional violence is approximately twice as common as male-to-female** (PASK, 2012), though **women sustain 62% of injuries** (Archer, 2000)" | Includes crucial consequence context |
| "Male disposability is an evolved trait" | "**Risk-taking and protective behaviors show sex-based variation**, potentially influenced by evolutionary pressures, socialization, and structural factors operating through gene-environment interaction" | Avoids biological determinism |
| "Society shows an empathy gap favoring women" | "**Self-reported empathy shows gender differences** that may reflect social expectations; EEG studies show no sex difference in neural empathy responses (Pang et al., 2023)" | Acknowledges contested nature |
| "Divorce causes male suicide" | "**Divorced men show 2.38x higher suicide risk** than married men (Kposowa, 2000), though causal mechanisms remain underspecified and natural experiments are absent" | Distinguishes correlation from causation |

---

## Part 7: Missing evidence to acknowledge as limitations

### Critical gaps requiring explicit acknowledgment

1. **No natural experiments on custody → male mortality**: The causal claim that custody arrangements affect male suicide lacks experimental validation. Correlational data cannot rule out selection effects.

2. **No direct implicit-vs-explicit mechanism comparison**: Only Thomassin et al. (2019) used IAT comparing mothers and fathers—replications and mechanism studies are needed.

3. **Sample limitations in IPV research**: CTS-based studies miss context, control, and coercion. Results differ dramatically by sample type (population vs. shelter vs. clinical).

4. **WEIRD samples dominate**: Most evidence comes from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic populations. Cross-cultural generalizability is limited.

5. **Longitudinal data sparse**: Most studies are cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies tracking parent socialization → adult male outcomes are rare.

6. **Effect sizes are small**: Where reported, most gender socialization effect sizes are small (d < 0.3). Practical significance may be limited.

7. **Publication bias**: Studies finding null results or counter-evidence may be underrepresented in the literature.

### Suggested limitations paragraph for publication

> "Several limitations constrain causal inference. First, natural experiments validating links between gender socialization or custody arrangements and male health outcomes are absent; correlational findings cannot exclude selection effects or reverse causality. Second, evidence on implicit versus explicit transmission mechanisms relies primarily on one IAT study (Thomassin et al., 2019), requiring replication. Third, IPV statistics from population surveys using the Conflict Tactics Scale may miss contextual factors including coercion, fear, and self-defense motivation, which affect interpretation. Fourth, most evidence derives from WEIRD populations, limiting cross-cultural generalizability. Finally, effect sizes in gender socialization research are generally small, and publication bias may inflate observed relationships."

## Conclusion: Path to publication

Making this model scientifically bulletproof requires three fundamental shifts. First, **reframe from deterministic claims to probabilistic tendencies**, acknowledging that biology influences rather than determines outcomes and that socialization shows substantial cultural variation. Second, **adopt integrative framing** that positions male outcomes research as complementary to—not competing with—feminist scholarship, explicitly engaging with feminist masculinities research showing how patriarchy harms men. Third, **acknowledge substantial evidence gaps**, particularly the absence of natural experiments establishing causality between custody/socialization and male mortality.

The model's strongest empirical foundations are bidirectional IPV statistics (robust across methodologies, though contested on contextual grounds) and correlational evidence linking parental attitudes to children's gender development. Its weakest foundations are causal claims about custody → male suicide (correlational only) and the implicit-mother/explicit-father dichotomy (not supported by current evidence).

For successful peer review, present findings with **epistemic humility**, use **validated instruments**, **preregister hypotheses**, **report effect sizes with confidence intervals**, and **explicitly engage counterarguments** rather than dismissing them. Distance the academic work from men's rights activist rhetoric while maintaining focus on empirically documented male disadvantages in specific domains.
