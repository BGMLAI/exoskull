# Legal inequalities affecting women in criminal and family law

Women face systematic disadvantages across criminal and family law systems worldwide, from near-total abortion bans causing documented deaths in Poland to **only 77 countries** globally having criminalized marital rape. This report presents evidence-based analysis of how legal frameworks fail women as both victims and economic actors, while examining the paradox that apparent advantages—like custody preferences—often mask burdens.

## A. Poland: Primary focus

### Criminal law — Women as victims

#### Domestic violence prevalence and systemic failures

**63% of Polish women** have experienced some form of domestic violence in their lifetimes, according to a leaked 2020 government-commissioned Kantar study. In police interventions, **74% of victims are women** while **91% of suspected perpetrators are men**. Yet only **8% of victims** ever notify prosecutors or police, revealing massive underreporting.

The "Blue Card" (Niebieska Karta) procedure, established in 1998 and institutionalized in 2010, coordinates responses across police, social workers, and healthcare professionals. However, a **2023 Supreme Audit Office (NIK) investigation** found devastating implementation failures:

| Failure metric | Finding |
|----------------|---------|
| Entities failing statutory compliance | 90% |
| Variation in Blue Card initiation rates | 5%–73% depending on district |
| Healthcare-initiated Blue Cards | Only 20 in audited regions |
| Education-initiated Blue Cards | Only 60 |

Only **31% of women** experiencing intimate partner violence report to police. Of 55,426 men reported for domestic violence in 2022, only **11,786 were sentenced**—a 21% conviction rate. The 2020 reform allowing police to immediately remove perpetrators for 14 days improved victim safety, but no systematic data exists on violation rates.

#### Femicide: 400+ deaths annually, no legal definition

Poland has **no legal definition of femicide** and does not systematically track intimate partner killings. Official police data recorded 91 women victims of homicide in 2022. However, the Women's Rights Centre (Centrum Praw Kobiet) estimates **400–500 women die annually** from domestic violence when including fatal beatings and violence-induced suicides. A 2020 Statista report estimated 400 femicides—reportedly the highest in Europe that year.

GREVIO, the Istanbul Convention monitoring body, noted that Polish courts often "find justification for perpetrators and interpret intentions other than murder," leading to femicide being misclassified as deadly assault. The Femicide Observatory project was established to address these data gaps.

#### Rape: The consent gap and victim-blaming

Article 197 of the Polish Criminal Code defines rape as requiring proof of **"force, illegal threat or deceit"**—placing the burden on victims to prove active resistance rather than lack of consent. This contradicts the Istanbul Convention's consent-based standard, which Poland ratified in 2015.

**Rape case attrition in Poland:**

| Stage | Number |
|-------|--------|
| Annual confirmed rape cases | ~1,300 |
| Perpetrators imprisoned | ~475 |
| Suspended sentences (2010–2016) | 31–41% |
| Sentences over 5 years | Only 21 people |

GREVIO found victims must demonstrate behavior within the "norm of sexual behaviour of decent women" and show "clear signal of non-consent to meet the 'normal Polish man' standard." In the 2024 murder of "Liza," a Belarusian woman, courts initially did not classify the act as rape because she "didn't scream" or show visible resistance—sparking the "Silent March" movement demanding legal reform.

#### Stalking, trafficking, and remaining gaps

Stalking was criminalized in 2011 under Article 190a, with penalties increased to **6 months–8 years** by a 2020 amendment. The FRA survey found 9% of Polish women experienced stalking, though prosecution requires a victim complaint—placing responsibility on victims rather than the state.

Poland achieved **Tier 1 status** in the 2024 US Trafficking in Persons Report, fully meeting minimum standards. Labor trafficking predominates (79% of prosecutions), with **1,043 victims** identified in 2023. Ukrainian refugees, predominantly women and children, remain particularly vulnerable.

Honor-based violence has no specific legislation in Poland. GREVIO noted the legal framework does **not specifically address honor crimes, forced marriage, or FGM**, though isolated cases among immigrant communities have been documented.

### Family law — Women's disadvantages

#### Divorce economics favor men

Research consistently shows women's incomes decline more sharply after divorce than men's, with some facing continuous poverty risk. Poland recorded **57,000 divorces in 2023**, most commonly in marriages lasting 5–9 years. While the default marital property regime requires equal (50/50) division, enforcement and valuation issues may disadvantage homemakers whose contributions are undervalued.

#### Alimony enforcement crisis

Polish law (Family and Guardianship Code Articles 133–135) provides for child and spousal maintenance, with no statutory tables—amounts determined case-by-case by judges. The fundamental problem is collection: the **recovery rate is only 25%**.

The Alimony Fund (Fundusz Alimentacyjny) maximum benefit increased from PLN 500 to **PLN 1,000/month** in 2024, available only when enforcement fails. Non-payment is criminal under Article 209 of the Penal Code (up to 2 years imprisonment), but enforcement remains inconsistent. One debtor accumulated a record **PLN 837,000** in unpaid alimony.

#### Custody: Declining maternal preference, persistent care burden

Poland has shifted dramatically from maternal custody dominance:

| Year | Custody to mothers alone |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1980 | 77.4% |
| 2022 | 24.5% |

However, Poland maintains **less than 5% equal joint physical custody**, compared to Sweden's 42.5%. UN Women data shows Polish women spend **17.6% of their time** on unpaid care and domestic work versus 9.5% for men—the custody "advantage" translates directly to unpaid labor burden.

The Family 500+ program (now PLN 800/month per child) reduced extreme child poverty from 11.9% to 4.7% but created an "inactivity trap"—female labor force participation dropped **2–3 percentage points**, disproportionately affecting lower-educated women.

#### Reproductive rights: Near-total abortion ban and documented deaths

The **October 22, 2020** Constitutional Tribunal ruling declared the fetal abnormality ground for abortion unconstitutional, eliminating **97–98% of legal abortions**. Only threat to the mother's life or pregnancy from criminal acts (rape/incest) remain legal.

**Legal abortions collapsed:**

| Year | Legal abortions |
|------|-----------------|
| 2019 | 1,110 |
| 2021 | 107 |
| 2023 | 425 |

**At least seven documented deaths** have been attributed to the law's "chilling effect" on doctors, including:

- **Izabela Sajbor (age 30)**, September 2021: 22 weeks pregnant with premature rupture of membranes; fetus had Edwards syndrome. Doctors waited for fetal heartbeat to stop. Her text to her mother: "Thanks to the abortion law I have to just lie here." She died of septic shock. Three doctors were convicted in July 2025.
- **Marta Sowinska**, April 2022: 20 weeks pregnant; doctors hesitated while fetus heartbeat remained detectable. Died of sepsis.

The European Court of Human Rights found Poland violated the Convention in *A.R. v. Poland* (November 2025). Poland is one of only **four countries globally** to roll back abortion access since the 1990s.

Emergency contraception requires a prescription—Poland is one of only **two EU countries** (with Hungary) requiring this. The 2022 European Contraception Atlas ranked Poland **worst in Europe** for contraception access at 31.5%.

### Criminal law — Women as offenders

#### Chivalry hypothesis: Lenient but paternalistic

Women represent approximately **10% of all crimes** in Poland (2003–2018) and **5.4% of the prison population** (3,703 women as of September 2025). Polish law explicitly provides for sentence deferral for pregnant women and women caring alone for children under 3 years.

Most common female crimes:
- Fraud (Article 286): ~7,000 convictions/year—the most "symptomatic" female crime
- Theft (Article 278): ~4,680 convictions/year
- Drunk driving (Article 178a): 53,895 convictions (2003–2018)

While comprehensive Polish studies on gender sentencing gaps are limited, international research finds men receive **63% longer sentences** controlling for crime type.

#### Prison conditions and mother-child units

Poland operates two mother-child units (Dom Matki i Dziecka):

| Facility | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Grudziądz Prison | Gynaecology/obstetrics hospital; pediatrician, psychologist, dietician; guards in civilian clothing |
| Krzywaniec Prison | "House Kindergarten" program; mothers employed as leaders; prisoners trained as nannies |

Children can remain with incarcerated mothers until **age 3**, with extensions possible based on medical/psychological opinion. Facilities accommodate 51 children and are designed to resemble normal domestic conditions. A new Scandinavian-style women's facility opened in Chmielów in October 2024 through Polish-Norwegian collaboration.

**Infanticide (Article 149)** has essentially disappeared: from 6–16 convictions annually in 2003–2012 to **zero convictions in 2017**, likely due to increased access to contraception and reduced stigma around unmarried motherhood.

## B. Europe and the EU: Comparative analysis

### Violence prevalence and the Istanbul Convention

The 2014 FRA survey of 42,000 women across 28 EU states found **one in three women (33%)** experienced physical and/or sexual violence since age 15; **one in two (50%)** experienced sexual harassment. Only **one in eight victims** reported to police.

**Istanbul Convention ratification status (2024):**

| Status | Countries |
|--------|-----------|
| Ratified | 38+ parties including Poland (2015), Germany (2017), EU itself (June 2023) |
| EU members NOT ratified | Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia |
| Withdrawn | Turkey (July 2021—the **only country** to withdraw) |

Poland signed in 2012 and ratified in 2015. The previous government announced withdrawal intentions in July 2020, but Prime Minister Tusk withdrew the Constitutional Tribunal challenge in January 2024.

### Femicide data gaps across Europe

An estimated **800 femicides** were reported across Europe in 2022, with **0.41 women per 100,000** killed by intimate partners/family members EU-wide. Only **four EU countries** have introduced legal definitions of femicide: Cyprus (2022), Malta (2022), Croatia (2024), and Italy (2025). Only 17 of 27 EU states provide intimate partner homicide data.

### Rape conviction rates: The justice gap

| Country | Conviction rate |
|---------|-----------------|
| Scotland | ~3% |
| England & Wales | 5–6% |
| Ireland | ~7% |

**22 of 31 European countries** still require proof of force, threat, or coercion rather than consent. Sweden's 2018 consent-based reform produced results: convictions rose **75%** (from 190 in 2017 to 333 in 2019), and prosecutions nearly doubled.

Marital rape criminalization timeline varies dramatically: Poland was among the first (1932), while Germany waited until 1997 and France until 2006. **All EU countries** have now criminalized marital rape.

### Abortion access: Poland among Europe's most restrictive

**European Abortion Policies Atlas 2025:**

| Country | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Sweden | 94.6% |
| France | 85.2% (constitutional right since March 2024) |
| Poland | 18.6% |
| Malta | 3.7% (life-of-mother exception only since 2023) |
| Andorra | ~5% (total ban) |

Ireland's 2018 referendum repealed the Eighth Amendment with 66.4% voting yes, catalyzed by the death of Savita Halappanavar. France became the **first country** to enshrine abortion in its constitution in March 2024.

### Custody trends favor joint arrangements

Joint physical custody has **doubled** in prevalence over 20 years, from 5.7% (2002–2010) to 13.0% (2021) of children aged 11–15. Belgium, Sweden, and Spain exceed 40% joint physical custody. Poland remains under 5%.

## C. World: Extremes and exceptions

### Divorce restrictions

The **Philippines** is the only UN member state where divorce is completely illegal (Vatican City is the only other jurisdiction). Women can only obtain annulment, costing approximately **50% of average annual income**. In **Saudi Arabia**, men can divorce by unilateral "talaq" effective immediately; women must prove harm or obtain husband's approval.

**Japan** requires women to wait 100 days after divorce before remarrying; no waiting period applies to men.

### Marital rape: Still legal in many countries

Only **77 countries** have explicit legislation criminalizing marital rape. **India** maintains Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Penal Code, exempting sexual intercourse by husbands. The government opposed criminalization in a 2024 Supreme Court affidavit, calling it "excessively harsh."

Other countries with explicit exemptions: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi. **18 Commonwealth countries** retain exemptions—a legacy of British colonial law treating women as property.

### Honor killings: 5,000–20,000 deaths annually

UNFPA estimates **5,000 women** killed annually for reasons of "honor"; NGOs estimate up to 20,000. Pakistan recorded over **1,000 honor killings per year** (official 2005 estimate). In Iran, at least **136 honor killings** were documented in nine months in 2024.

Jordan's Article 340 of the Penal Code exempts from punishment those who kill female relatives found "guilty" of adultery. Italy maintained reduced sentences (3–7 years instead of murder penalties) for "honor" killings until 1981.

### Male guardianship persists

Saudi Arabia's 2022 Personal Status Law codified male guardianship: women need a male guardian to marry regardless of age. Reforms since 2019 allow women over 21 to obtain passports and travel without male permission, but guardians can still withhold consent for higher education abroad. Women need male guardian permission to leave prison even after sentence completion.

### Testimony value: Women's word worth less

In **Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan (Sharia courts), and Thailand (southern provinces)**, women's testimony is legally worth half of men's, based on Qur'an 2:282. In **Yemen**, women's testimonies are not permitted at all in adultery and retribution cases.

### FGM: 230+ million affected globally

Over **230 million** girls and women alive today have undergone FGM, practiced in **92 countries**. Prevalence reaches 99.2% in Somalia, 95% in Guinea, and 87% in Egypt (27 million women—highest absolute number).

The **UK** criminalized FGM in 1985 but achieved only **3 convictions** by 2024, despite an estimated 137,000 survivors living in England and Wales. France, by contrast, prosecuted **over 100 parents and 2 practitioners** in 40+ criminal cases by 2014.

### Dowry deaths in India: ~7,000 annually

India records approximately **7,000 dowry deaths annually** (NCRB data), with 2022 seeing 6,450 registered cases. Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code provides minimum 7 years imprisonment, but conviction rates are **only 32%**. Uttar Pradesh leads with 2,000+ cases annually; Delhi accounts for 30% of dowry deaths among major cities.

### Inheritance inequality codified

All Arab countries apply Islamic inheritance law, where daughters inherit **half** what sons inherit, wives inherit 1/8 if the husband leaves children (versus husband's 1/4). Tunisia's cabinet approved an equal inheritance bill in 2019—the first Arab country to attempt reform—but parliamentary action remains pending.

## D. Paradoxes and nuances

### The chivalry effect: Benevolent sexism in sentencing

Starr's landmark 2012 study found US men receive **63% longer sentences** than women controlling for crime, and women are **twice as likely** to avoid incarceration if convicted. UK research confirms men are 1.1–3.2 times more likely to receive immediate custody than women across crime categories.

However, this "chivalry" is **selective**: it disappears for violent crimes (Rodriguez et al. 2006), and Black women do **not** receive the same leniency as white women (Koons-Witt et al. 2012). Critics argue lighter sentencing "infantilizes women, is based on stereotyping, and is incompatible with gender equality." Increasing female judges **decreases** the disparity, suggesting paternalistic bias among male judges.

### Custody advantage masks economic burden

The "motherhood penalty" cuts women's incomes **in half** on average after having children, with earnings depressed for at least six years. Employers call mothers back for interviews **half as often** as childless women.

Critically, contested custody cases are rare: only **2–10% of divorces** involve disputes. When fathers actively seek physical custody, they win primary or joint custody **over 70% of the time** (Massachusetts Gender Bias Study). The assumption that courts systematically deny fathers custody is not supported by evidence on contested cases.

### Female perpetrators: Underrecognized reality

Official police reports show **2.2% of sexual offenses** committed by females, but victimization surveys reveal **11.6%**—six times higher. In intimate partner violence, bidirectional violence occurs in 51.9% (school/college samples) to 72.3% (legal/treatment samples) of cases.

Underreporting stems from social taboo, gender stereotypes (women who assault men are viewed as victims), and minimization by male victims. Female perpetrators show different patterns: more likely to have single incidents (62% vs 38% for males) and to co-offend.

### Protection versus paternalism: Historical lessons

"Protective" labor laws of the 1890s–1960s—night work bans, maximum hours restrictions, weight limits—**limited women's opportunities** rather than protecting them. New NBER research argues "the main driver behind protective labor laws was men's desire to shield themselves from labor market competition."

This tension continues in sex work policy. The Nordic Model (criminalizing buying, decriminalizing selling) is opposed by the Global Network of Sex Work Projects, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, WHO, and UNAIDS. Research shows **96% of sex workers** in Nordic regions report negative effects, including reduced bargaining power and being pushed underground.

### Intersectionality: Compounded disadvantages

Kimberlé Crenshaw's intersectionality framework reveals how Black women, Indigenous women, immigrants, and disabled women face compounded legal disadvantages. Indigenous women in Canada represent **16% of female homicide victims** but only 4.3% of population. The *Oliphant v. Suquamish* decision (1978) created a jurisdictional gap: tribal courts cannot prosecute non-Natives, though **67% of assaults** against Native American women are perpetrated by non-Natives.

### The credibility gap in sexual assault cases

Research demonstrates "overwhelming evidence" that rape myths affect juror evaluation of evidence. Mock jurors endorsing rape myths rated testimony more truthful if reported immediately; victims face contradictory expectations about emotional display—"controlled victims may be disbelieved when they do not cry," while "expressive witnesses who cry 'too much' may be dismissed as hysterical."

Ellison and Munro (2009) found jurors "reluctant to accept freezing as a viable explanation" for lack of resistance—even with expert testimony, they were "unwilling to accept that a victim of rape would fail to fight back."
